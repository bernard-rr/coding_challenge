HatExpensive2537,"This is a fine workaround until it can get fixed. We don't know what end is leaking. If the female end is leaking (and they don't need this drop) they could disconnect the drop entirely. But this is fine, you see all kinds of crazy things the are cobbled together in Vet med.|How would that happen? The flowmeter takes it from 50psi (or whatever the Central system is set at) down to 0-4L/min. The only thing this will do if it came undone is to blow out oxygen from the quick connect fitting, thus wasting oxygen. Unless the anesthesia machine itself had a leak in the high pressure system, and the pop off was closed, and no one did a pressure test, and no one was watching the patient... this would not cause barotrauma.

Sea_Explanation6496,"They usually show you around the clinic and introduce you to the other staff members and maybe have you shadow someone for a bit. I have had one job hand me a worksheet that had common veterinary pharmacy questions on it (this was a vet assistant pharmacy position).

PancakesWaffles72,"Working during the school year is very doable as long as you’re good with time management. A lot of my classmates worked tech jobs, pet sat, or worked at the school. You have to be able to balance getting your studies/assignments done, work, and then make personal time for yourself.

Dry-Cartographer7591,"A couple of guidelines I have been taught are: 

•Basically you want to show your interest by researching each school’s program, finding out what you can, and asking about what interests you, what concerns you might have, what might make that school a better opportunity or a better fit for you than another.
—I’ll give the caveat that with the way LSU SVM’s website was set up when I was preparing to interview, my digging was not very fruitful

•Keep in mind that the interview isn’t just for them to shore up their interest in you but also for you to shore up your interest in that program: Is this a place you want to spend 4 grueling years of your life? Are the clinicians there people you want to work with and learn from?

•In general—at least I’ve been told that—they generally have a pretty good idea of who they want to admit before the interviews; so as long as you don’t say anything too outlandish, it probably won’t hurt your odds of being admitted|I am an LSU grad (c/o 2021) and would be happy to answer specific questions you might have about LSU in particular|Any in western NC?",Other
ReindeerVarious3024,"I’m a human doctor who has fostered many a dog, and this is eye opening to me. I had no idea it was illegal to administer vaccines to animals, and while I haven’t done it myself, I also can’t say I have ever actually looked into the topic. I have, however, been around others (also human doctors in the field of rescue work) who I absolutely witnessed giving injections to puppies/dogs that would come through the rescues we worked with. The vaccines from what I recall were provided by the rescue, but I may be mistaken. Otherwise I have no idea where/how the actual vaccine was obtained. On another note, I was often provided with human medications for dogs, and had to adjust dose based on weight. I assumed these meds all come from the same pharmacy and that there likely wasn’t actual differences in the meds based on human vs dog prescription.

5x 8 hr days

10 days PTO

$1750 CE / yr

This is a cool idea I wish I knew about this sub when I interviewed lol|This is going to be a rant

I was put with one, but she is not pleasant to be around

I don’t ask a lot of questions, sometimes just “across the room” questions like “how do you do your tapering pred dose” or something simple

Maybe a question once every other day about something minute, and she complained to the manager saying that if she has to help me then she wants half of the production

I also never worked in gp before (I have a strictly wildlife only background) so i don’t know if this behavior is normal or not. So I look up everything. Ive looked up leg amputations, cystotomies, foreign bodies, and most things I feel is OK for a GP to do and isn’t super complex

It was annoying but mentally not bad for me. I know that as long as I understand the theory behind what I’m doing and listen to specialists on youtube / few websites who give their insight, itll be alright. Especially parts where they talk about common mistakes they see in GP, I feel that is super valuable too. Usually theres some bit about that in any article

After I told the guy who hired me about that, I work alone now and I much prefer it. Though it would still be nice to have someone else around to get their thoughts on complicated cases. 

Edit: I just remembered that shes the opposite and she is too scared to look things up and now asks me how to do some procedures like digit amputations or legs. I help but for the good of the practice only, otherwise I sure as hell wouldnt want to|https://youtu.be/JuMtwZ-HBqc?si=KnG90RtnjOFUw6Fg

I would forget to do some things, like add on meds or maybe some diagnostic… but it has not been a big deal in the end, I’m assuming its likely been the same for you as well

Pretty much as soon as I realized that, it stopped mattering to me. Also I look up a lot of stuff and its not a big deal too, a lot of my seniors did the same. They learned most of their surgeries from youtube and a few sites (like vetfolio, dvm360, cliniciansbrief, etc) and I’m doin the same

usernameTH1S,"I agree with the principle of this letter, but devils advocate, some of this is just not really true. At least not everywhere. I went through internship and finished residency last year, and have also been part of the intern selection committee several times including this past year.
- my residency was private practice with expectation to work for them after, and I did not get a low ball offer. I interviewed and looked at some other non corp positions just to see, and they made the same or worse offers. I felt like my hospital really wanted me to stay and was actually very competitive even with the expectation I would stay. 
- salaries: definitely suck but outside of academia, seem to be getting better every year. VCAs are paying interns $80k I believe which is definitely livable. I’m biased bc in California intern salaries are regulated by min wage laws but definitely not true everywhere so for sure could be better. 
- Quality of life: also can definitely suck, but my impression is there is a consistent trend towards more sustainable intern life. My hospital (and I think all programs in the area) have 2 guaranteed days off, and actually get 3 in a row off when they are on ER (they work 4 days/week). Don’t get me wrong there is certainly room for improvement but it is definitely better even than when I was an intern. 
- selection process: I can only speak to the intern selection but it is 100% merit based. I put in probably 30 hours each VIRMP season reviewing/interviewing applicants and then a huge meeting to decide on rank order. It is very unbiased I would say, we just want good people that will succeed in our hospital and will hopefully get out of it what they were looking for. 

I know my experience is not everyone else’s and there should be improvements. But the verbiage of this letter does not reflect my experience in a great many ways.|Male DACVECC in San Diego CA. $225k base with 25% pooled production, total $250-270k range.

Sometimes working 4 shifts/week (short staffed), prob twice every couple months.|Agreed there is no best 😕 the most consistent thing you will hear is that it is location dependent - local hospital management and often the regional management. For example I work at a VCA hospital and for the most part feels the least “corporate-y” of the ones I have experience with, but when I fill in at other VCA hospitals I get the gross corporate ick. Ultimately no easy answer you really have to go hospital by hospital.|Two things
1) You’re being too hard on yourself, and EVERYONE has the sense of “imposter syndrome” at some point (usually many points) of their training/career. I’m a ER/critical care specialist and very confident in my skills/knowledge, but even so once in a while I still find myself thinking “these people seem smarter than me”. Just push through it because it’s all in our heads 🙂
2) Being “smart” is over rated as far as vet and med school goes. Yes your life is easier if you have a good memory or naturally good critical thinking skills, but that is 10% of undergrad/vet school. 90% of it is discipline and study skills, which it sounds like you have.

That's just how it be sometimes.

For lame dogs, I tend to have the pain relief discussion less in terms of pain (""he's not painful, he's just lame"" owners will sometimes say) and more in terms of the anti-inflammatory effect. I'll generally say something along the lines of ""I suspect we're dealing with a soft tissue injury, like a sprain or a strain. We should start a course of anti-inflammatories, which will help settle any swelling, and help him recover faster. He will still need to be rested while he's on the medication to avoid making the injury worse. It's also useful to use the medication, because if he doesn't improve, that could indicate a more serious injury, like a cruciate tear, and we may need to do an x-ray"".

Like this, I've presented my opinion without making it seem optional, I've explained why the medication is useful beyond pure pain relief (because a shocking amount of owners won't care about that aspect), and I've also floated the idea of it being a diagnostic tool- in that non-improvement would indicate a need to look further.

Unfortunately, some people are just going to be assholes about it. Just make sure you document as thoroughly as possible in those cases.|I saw a dog while shadowing in vet school that was being treated for lipeamia (or maybe hypertriglygereamia?) And was meant to be on a low fat diet. I did the initial history taking- O reports she's feeding the new diet as instructed. The new diet is home cooked I think, so she goes into a lot of detail, but overall it all seems appropriate. The vet is frustrated and confused because the bloods aren't improving. She goes out back to do something, leaving me in the room with the client. We're chatting, and, like 40 mins into the appointment, she mentions his ""protein balls"", which she uses to tablet him and are NOT part of the diet.

I went to vet school straight out of high school (in Australia). Probably the no 1 advice I would have had for prospective vet students would be to do a year working as a vet nurse first. It will give you a bit of a leg up on some of the coursework, and it will give you a chance to assess if this is something you actually want. 

Personally, I'm very happy where I am. I enjoy the work, euthanasia animals has never been an issue for me. Vet school was very rough though.|The last 3 years of my 5 year course felt like an emotional meat grinder. You'd be in lectures from 8-5 all week, then you'd need to somehow try to allocate an hour of study for each hour of coursework, which was impossible. I basically had no free time because I was studying, and if I wasn't studying (because I needed a break, for a doctor's appointment, because I had a social commitment), I'd spend the whole time feeling guilty for not studying. It is the hardest I've ever worked, and, most of the time, it was not enough and I had to sit supplementary exams. A couple of the lecturers could be pretty unsympathetic (or, at least, I was in such a state of stress that it felt unsympathetic). One of them, in our clinical year, would just yell at you while you were anaesthetising an animal (I guess to teach you how to work under pressure?). All of this was compounded by the financial stress of being a student with no secure source of income.

It seems highly unlikely to me that you could make it through vet school without getting exposure to serious wounds. You will also be doing a lot of cadaver work, as well as surgery practice on live animals (in the final years).

Tolerance to gore is something that can be worked on. Many people start out squeamish and get over it over time.

I think this would be a really great end goal, however I feel like the transition is being a bit rocky since we have so few staff. I was wondering if, at least for now, it would be OK if I opted out of having a shadowing tech until we get some more staff on board. I'm used to writing my own notes, and would prefer to write them myself. This would free up an extra tech to help out at back, and hopefully will help smooth the transition a bit until we can get some extra techs onboard.""

Personally, I'm very happy where I am. I enjoy the work, euthanasia animals has never been an issue for me. Vet school was very rough though.|The last 3 years of my 5 year course felt like an emotional meat grinder. You'd be in lectures from 8-5 all week, then you'd need to somehow try to allocate an hour of study for each hour of coursework, which was impossible.

A couple of the lecturers could be pretty unsympathetic (or, at least, I was in such a state of stress that it felt unsympathetic). One of them, in our clinical year, would just yell at you while you were anaesthetising an animal (I guess to teach you how to work under pressure?).

For lame dogs, I tend to have the pain relief discussion less in terms of pain (""he's not painful, he's just lame"" owners will sometimes say) and more in terms of the anti-inflammatory effect.

Like this, I've presented my opinion without making it seem optional, I've explained why the medication is useful beyond pure pain relief (because a shocking amount of owners won't care about that aspect), and I've also floated the idea of it being a diagnostic tool- in that non-improvement would indicate a need to look further.

Clinics are desperate. The externships I did always told me “let us know if you’re interested and we’ll send you an offer”

But why does it matter how many offers you’re getting anyway? I decided on my top 2 clinics after externships, both gave me offers upon request, no interview required unless I had questions for them. I chose one of the two. Done and done.|I’m a new vet, and I definitely could have been happier in a different career. I was the same way before.

Obviously you can specialize and things would look different, but most of us end up in small animal GP to start.

Vet school. The hardest part is NOT getting in as much as people want to make that joke. It’s hard to get in. It’s harder to stay motivated to finish. It’s crappy. There’s too much knowledge to retain, more than half of it won’t ever apply (but you need to know it to pass boards), and yet you’re still never really prepared for the real world. It’s so costly (I had really good undergrad scholarships, commuted, and only paid about $10k total, but vet school… $$$$$$).

Being a vet. The hardest part is not putting down animals. That’s what naive people think. That decision is hard for the pet owner. The vet is just there to provide the service. It’s actually sometimes one of the better parts. The hard parts are being over worked, not having enough trained support staff, dealing with difficult or uneducated owners, and not having work life balance. You can get great pay as a vet. But is it worth it to not have a life outside of work? No. Some days I don’t see my toddler because I don’t get home until she’s asleep. Sometimes you don’t get a lunch break. Sick days? Better figure something out because you have patients that need to be seen. Long vacations? If you even get enough time off, you better plan those way in advance. The good parts of the job— leaving on time (rare), seeing the human-animal bond, figuring out a challenging case, CE conventions and being with people who understand the high level stress job.

My advice? Work a a clinic, see the stress firsthand. That’s your future. Go to college, take random classes that peak your interest- photography? History? Earth science? A new language? Art? Open your mind and you will find other opportunities that will bring you joy. You don’t have to decide something this big right now.

meghanhoe,"1. Do NOT lose sleep to study. Pick a time of day you will be done (I made it earlier and earlier as school went on 😂 but vowed I would never study so late that it would take away from sleep!)

2. Be open to changing your mind about your career. I was very set on internship and residency but realized that GP has a lot to offer too should not be undervalued compared to academia (basically don’t feel like you are not as high achieving because becoming a DVM alone is such a huge accomplishment and a ton of work/knowledge is required for it too). 

3. Have a small circle and do not feel like you need to be around people who cause drama. There is zero extra energy to put up with all of that and I found that the smaller my circle was the more peace I had. 

4. Find other hobbies unrelated to vet med and make time for it every day. Doesn’t matter what it is, you just need complete separation from it to quell the burn out. 

5. Get involved in clubs like HSVMA/other clubs that allow students to practice surgery, hugely helpful before junior surgery starts to have some idea of the common procedures :)

6. Use Notion for studying. Make a table for every class and you can add a date to the table so you know when you last studied that material. I would make a Notion page with the toggle features for every lecture every single day so it was essentially in flash card format (using professors slides) so that when it was time to study, my study materials were already made for me!!

step1step2profit,"For cardio, the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program. I haven't been in the match for awhile, but it seems like interns from CSU, Tufts, Ohio, TAMU, NC State, and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency. So I can't answer your question about externship vs research program directly; go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship.

That being said, while it's great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career, make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship. Your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician. It's also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects, not just cardiology. The specialty world is small and it is not uncommon for residency committees to reach out to friends in non-cardiology specialists to ask about candidates (unofficially).",Other

shadowofzero,"Amerivet Veterinary Partners. I've been in this game for over 20 years, starting as a kennel assistant and made it to vet school. My whole life i avoided corporate (VCA and Banfield were the major players at my start). eventually I crossed paths with both and got a taste of corporate vs my preferred private practice. Since my start in this game, private is almost all but absorbed by corporate players. Because of the way time has played out for the vet field, most of us got absorbed or chose to go with corporate for the reasons corporate looks attractive. I've always hated corporate veterinary, and have worked for 6 different companies in my tenure, most of which have been mentioned on this thread. I took a chance and chose AmeriVet, new company in the vet world. I've never been happier in my career. Yeah, there's still the corporate chain and rules, but the culture has been built by people who saw what was wrong with the other companies and chose to make a better choice. As a skeptical pessimist, I took a risk and I am glad to be happy with them.|Honestly, considering that they are a newer company, they have been growing and getting their shit together faster than I expected. I hired 3 DVMs 6-7 months ago(1 mentor, 2 new grads) and they have been excelling as professionals. The ideals and culture they promote and talk about... They actually follow.

Look, let's be real. Corporate is corporate. They're there to make money, like any other business. Private practice is becoming difficult to sustain in the markets that have been molded post pandemic. There's more financial security with the structure of the model they've created. At the end of the day, it's not that I'm pro-corperate, I'm pro-financial security. I live in a major metropolitan area where the cost of living is high and pet ownership is just as important as having a family. Weighing my options, I thrive in a workplace that has structure and peace of mind when it comes to being able to get paid. My ideals go well with a company that actually cares and has learned from the mistakes of VCA/Banfield/etc|*LAUGHS IN VETERINARY*",Veterinarian
Icy_External6132,"Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist. 

To me, it's ""worth it"" as i get to do quite a bit of hands on, and I feel happy from being able to help my patients to recover from illness (not all the cases, but we always do our best). The journey of investigating the root cause of issues may be challenging, but it's definitely worth it, even if it's a bad or good diagnosis. 

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important. Sometimes I just stay in my room doing nothing (literally nothing, just to get myself rested); sometimes I go for a walk; sometimes I read something (non vet or science related) at a cafe; sometimes I hangout with my friends (talk about life and avoids anything work related)........ you just have to find your own way! 

Good luck! (:|Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist. 

To me, it's ""worth it"" as i get to do quite a bit of hands on, and I feel happy from being able to help my patients to recover from illness (not all the cases, but we always do our best). The journey of investigating the root cause of issues may be challenging, but it's definitely worth it, even if it's a bad or good diagnosis. 

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important.

Crackers2,"A) all cat spays flank with modified millers. I have now opted to just remove ovaries instead of OVH as according to a few studies there is no difference and I find there is less tissue handling. Will do midline spays if pregnant or fancy cat where owner is scared coat will grow back differently. I use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, monofast/monocryl for muscle layers + SC and intradermals

B) cat neuter, incision on each testicle and autoligation. No collar or sutures or glue needed. 

C)Dog spay, modified millers around ovaries as with cat spays but will go midline. Again opting for just ovaries nowadays. Hoping to learn lap spays in future. Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, PDS for muscle layer, monofast/monocryl for SC+intradermals

D) dog neuters pre scrotal approach, closed castration ligating modified millers. Doesn't matter the size of the dog. If elderly dog will do scrotal ablation as well as tend to find these get very bruised and huge hematomas. Tend to use monofast/monocryl for ligatures + SC + intradermals but will use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures at times.

The free trial is based on number of medical records instead of a timeframe which is also nice. This is my referral link which is good for an extra 25 medical records on top of the usual 50:

DrVetDent,"I'm one of those pesky 17yr old Scottish students who got into vet school straight out the gate, graduated at 22, and now in North America prepping for a specialty college board exam 🙋‍♂️ i.e. the root cause of your partners application problems.

Jokes aside, I want to highlight that your partner IS NOT competing with the UK high school students - each university allocates spots to UK and to international applicants (and in Scotland, some spaces for Scottish students, some rest of UK, and then international). This comes down to requirements from the government regarding university funding.

High school education in the UK vs North America is like comparing apples and oranges, unless your high school ran an International Baccalaureate program. We are examined at a level equivalent to year 1-2 of a North American undergrad degree before starting vet school.

Long story short, your partner is competing with fellow North Americans. And she is applying to three of the top 10 vets schools in the world (RVC, Edinburgh, Glasgow), which have ~40 international spots up for grabs/yr.

Best of luck to her, I hope that she is successful soon!|I think you skipped over the part of my reply where I pointed out that she is not competing against UK students. The UK government requires that a certain number of spots are reserved for domestic candidates, while a certain number are open to international/foreign trained students. 

I went to Edinburgh, where ~60% of my year were from the UK or Europe, and the remaining 40% were North American. Unsure of how the allocation of positions has changed since Brexit, but anecdotally I've heard it's more 50:50 Domestic:North American. AVMA-accredited, so it was relatively easy to cross the pond.

Present-Diamond7994,"I am licensed in Korea and in USA.

In Korea, you go straight to vet school after high school and you spend 6 years at the vet school to become a vet (GP). And the degree is not a doctorate. In USA, you have to go to college and complete prerequisite courses first in order to be able to apply for the vet school. College undergrad degree is not required but many students get bachelor’s degree before going into vet school. Once you graduate from the vet school, you are a doctor (the degree is called Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine).

She moved away and my new solo practice vet charges a an exam fee $20 more than previous vet but meds are sold at about $5 more than ordering from a well known public vendor. 

The new vet ends up costing less because the meds aren’t marked up so high. 

One practice in the high money area requires full blood panel and chest X-rays for all spay/neuters, regardless of the pets age. That’s a $250 fee before the pet is sedated for spay/neuter.

PrettyButEmpty,"If you are in the US, ACVS requires a rotating internship or equivalent (I think 5 years?) clinical experience in private practice. Realistically, this means that almost everyone who wants a surgical residency does an internship. Twofold: meeting the requirement, and possibly even more importantly making contacts with surgeons. Applying for residency requires you to submit letters of rec from ACVS diplomats. If you are out in practice for 5 years, and the only surgeons you know are your professors from school, it will be challenging to get the number and quality of letters that you need to successfully match. 

Given the competitive nature of surgical residencies, it is also common for applicants to complete 1 or more surgical internships, so I would also keep that in mind during your calculations.  

If you work in a position that allows you to maintain regular contact and good relationships with surgeons, an alternative path could be an option. But it’s an uphill battle, unfortunately. I have also heard it expressed by multiple surgeons that they prefer new doctors as residents as they are “less likely to have bad habits”, so I would also be leery of that bias harming you. 

In general, if you REALLY want to be a surgeon and you can financially swing it, going the internship route will probably give you the best shot. If you would be happy as an ER doctor you can still do a lot of surgery, and you can step out of vet school into a job paying easily 200k. I’m a surgeon; I love it and don’t regret my choices at all, but you need to really want it, and it definitely comes with some opportunity cost.|No problem, happy to help. 

Publications can help, but mainly if they are relevant to surgery. A lot of people have undergrad research, which is great but falls more under the “positive extracurricular” category rather than being a big plus. 

Where research can help you is if you are doing it with one or more surgeons, who then know you and can write letters for you. Or if you manage to publish a paper that could essentially be a back up paper for your credentials. (When you finish your residency you will need to submit a collection of things to ACVS in order to be approved to take boards. One of the things you must submit is proof that you have completed and published a research paper in an approved journal contributing to the surgical literature. Normally this is a paper you have worked on as a resident, but if you have an acceptable paper from earlier in your career that can be used as well).|Sometimes there are kittens, and no one looks at you oddly when you do things like put them down your shirt or pretend to eat their heads.|8am EST, and you get your results by logging into the website. If you match, yay, someone from your future program will likely reach out in the next week to greet you and provide further information. 

If you don’t match you’ll enter what is called the scramble. You’ll be able to look at the list of programs with open positions, and will reach out by email to express your interest in any of those programs. It is a time sensitive process- while not matching can be emotionally difficult, this is a situation where you want to quickly consider your options, and assuming you wish to continue seeking an internship, jump right into reaching out to programs. Everyone else will be doing the same thing, so spots can go quickly and things are dynamic. You will also likely be contacted by programs interested in you, as a list of unmatched applicants is also provided to them. You’ll want to be ready to quickly vet those programs so you can let them know yes or no, before move on to the next option.

Lots of people come into vet school wanting to be surgeons, and lots of people find that actually, cardiology, or shelter medicine, or dermatology really speaks to them and inspires a passion they had no idea existed! Or they realize that having to chose just one thing feels so limiting, and decide to go into GP to see a little bit of everything and simultaneously get to develop relationships with clients and patients that span the pet’s entire life. Or they realize clinical medicine and dealing with clients all day just really grates, and maybe being a pathologist or a radiologist is more their style. Vet school, and to a lesser extent internship is about trying different things and finding out what you really like, and I always encourage students to take advantage of those opportunities, because you just never know what will strike your fancy!

That said, some people come in wanting to be surgeons and that passion carries them all the way through! It is a competitive specialty, so if you think you want to be a surgeon, it will work in your favor to start taking steps in that direction from early in your vet school career. Figure out a way to make contacts with the surgery service at your school- is there an on call student position? Does someone need help with a research project? Is there a surgery club you could seek a leadership position in to work with the faculty advisor and plan wetlabs? Make those connections early, and work to maintain them- having those people to ask for advice, to help get you strong letters for the internship and residency match, and potentially to get involved with research is one of the most important things you can do to achieve your goals. 

Along with networking, the other thing you want to do as a preclinical student is work hard in class to develop a strong knowledge base and achieve good grades. Grades are not the only thing people look at when choosing residency candidates, but they do speak to a person’s test taking skill and diligence in preparing for exams, and as a surgeon you will be expected to pass a multipart board exam. They can also help give you an edge over other similar candidates if your grades are particularly good. 

During your fourth year you will be on clinical rotations, so moving between different services in the hospital as well as externships. Here is where you will be pulling everything together, so again you will want to work hard and put a lot into prepping for your cases. Usually that’s easy for people to do on surgery when they want to be surgeons, but remember you will also have to do surgery on diabetics, and talk to clients about their pet’s cancer diagnosis, and many surgeons don’t have access to an anesthesiologist for all their cases and will be overseeing their technicians instead. So what I’m saying is every rotation matters! 

Hopefully, if you’ve been working hard in your preclinical classes and you continue doing well in clinics, it shouldn’t be too hard to find people to write letters of recommendation for you. Because the other thing that happens in fourth year is the internship match. If you go on the VIRMP website (www.VIRMP.org) you can see what applying for internship looks like. You send in your transcript, put together a personal statement and CV, and most importantly have 3-4 of your faculty write you strong letters supporting your application. This is where those connections you have made with surgery people and your rockstar performance on clinics start to pay off. Usually you want to get letters from at least a couple different specialists (not ONLY surgeons) because this first application is for a rotating internship position. 

As a rotating internship you will move between services (kind of like for clinical rotations) but generally you spend most of your time on surgery, medicine, and ER with variable amounts of elective time depending on your program. As an intern you are a doctor, but you will generally have some level of supervision and people you can ask questions, and depending on the program you may not always have primary case responsibility just yet. It’s kind of a weird, in between time, but once again it provides time for you to gain more experience and confidence with managing cases and talking to clients, as well as making connections. Once again, when you start your rotating, reach out to the surgery department. See if someone is willing to be your mentor, and possibly guide you into completing a short research project during your internship, maybe also presenting it at a national conference. Those sorts of things, as well as working hard again to make sure you get strong letters, will help your second VIRMP application be as strong as possible. 

When you go through Match the second time, that’s when you’ll apply for the specialty match. Most people apply for both surgical internships and surgical residencies, just because it is highly competitive, and even with the strong application you’ve ideally been building matching to residency straight out of rotating internship isn’t guaranteed. Most people do 1-2 surgical internships before matching for residency. If you do match for internship rather than residency, use the time to address any gaps in your application. Push to complete that research project and get it published. Keep making new connections in the surgery world and maintain old ones. Work to improve your technical skills and case management. 

Most residencies are three year programs (I think there are a couple four year programs out there as well, where one year is spent completing your research project). As a resident you will primarily be responsible for seeing and cutting cases. You will see both soft tissue and ortho cases, and will also be expected to have exposure to neurosurgical cases to some degree. You will keep a log of your cases, ensuring that you are seeing enough volume and variety of cases. You will also regularly meet for didactic training- journal club, case reviews things like that, and you will be expected to prepare several talks and present to your peers over the course of your residency (like for grand rounds). You are expected to complete a research project during residency (even if you already have a publication) and you will receive time off clinics for that and for the handful of out rotations that are required (anesthesia, IM/critical care, pathology, radiology). Your paper must be accepted no later than the August after you finish residency and must be in an approved journal. It cannot be a case report. 

Residents take Phase I boards as second years, and can repeat it again as third years if necessary. At the conclusion of your residency you submit your logs documenting that you have met all required case numbers/out rotations/presentations/etc, submit your accepted research paper, and obtain a final set of reference letters from your mentors. Assuming those items are in order and you have passed Phase I, you then take Phase II the Feb after your residency (most people graduate in July). Once you pass Phase II…. You are finally a boarded surgeon! 

Easy, right?|Spaghetti, I’ve worked with interns for 10 years now, after being one myself. Internship sucks. You go from being a student, where no one trusts you to do anything but the most basic of tasks, to all of a sudden being expected to be personally responsible for the well being of potentially very sick animals. Hopefully you have some degree of supervision/people you can ask, but it feels like everyone who’s supposed to be helping you is just annoyed with you. You’re constantly sleep deprived. You feel like you’re so busy running around and doing paperwork that you have no time to read up on things or review.

Plus, internship further distills the Type A, driven, perfectionist types who go to vet school into the MOST Type A, driven, perfectionist types. People who judge their own performance harshly and have a hard time accepting any deviation from the way they think things should be. You make mistakes because you’re a novice, or you’re tired, or maybe it’s not even a mistake and just a difference in how institutions treat certain types of cases, and you use those incidents to punish yourself. Because surely, if you were a GOOD doctor, internship would be easy, right? 

It’s your mind playing tricks on you. If you haven’t been kicked out, if you haven’t been sat down by the administrators and had any very serious discussions, if you haven’t been instructed that your cases have to be supervised differently and more closely than your internmates, then you’re probably at least doing fine. Odds are that other people don’t perceive you in the same way you’re seeing yourself. You are judging yourself against perfection. Others are judging you against the standard they expect from an intern. ALL interns make mistakes. ALL interns have gaps in their knowledge. ALL interns have limited procedural competence. You are there to learn and gain experience and grow as a doctor, and anyone who makes you feel bad about not being perfect right out of vet school is projecting their own issues onto you. 

It’s ok to hate your internship. Maybe you’re dealing with a lot of toxic people, maybe you really have no support, maybe you’re being treated as cheap labor and a just meat shield in ER. It’s ok to quit your internship if it’s not providing the experience you feel will help you get to where you want to be. But before you do that, I would do a couple things. 

1. Carve out some time to see a doctor. They will understand. They went through internship themselves, and if you look at any of the medical subs you’ll see that burn out and depression are just as common in human med. Ask about getting on medication to help interrupt some of the cycle of negative thoughts and emotions. 

2. Talk to your mentors. Who is supervising you? Is there anyone you trust to discuss these feelings of inadequacy with, someone who can give you an outside perspective? Someone who, if there are any specific things you need to improve, can give you advice about the best way to build your skills in those areas? 

3. Try to schedule time to see a therapist. Maybe look at virtual options to allow more flexibility. They can potentially help you identify patterns of thinking that are working against you and give you strategies to break these patterns. 

4. It’s so hard as an intern, but try to carve out a little time for yourself to do some of the things you used to like to do. Most interns have so little free time that their main hobbies become “catch up on sleep” and “do laundry”. When was the last time you went on a hike? Or cooked a special meal, or did a little knitting, or sketched something? I think during training it is so easy to become dissociated from the person you are outside of work, but maintaining some connection with that person really helps. 

Try some of these things, if you feel you can. And if you still feel like leaving your internship, that’s ok. It’s ok to say “this isn’t for me”. But I hope it will be after you’ve taken a fresh look at the situation with a clear head, and you’ve realized your life plan is going to be different. Not because you’re holding yourself to an impossible standard, and now you’re crumbling, feeling like you can’t meet it. It’s ok not to be perfect, and it’s ok to forgive yourself for not being perfect, as long as you learn from your mistakes. 

You’re not alone.|You can also ligate the horns individually to prevent this.|Well, if you’ve been mostly on research rotations so far, it’s probably true that your technical skills are behind your classmates who have been more consistently in the clinic. That’s ok. You’ve got a whole career ahead of you to work on your technical skills. Everyone freaks out about being bad at things like blood draws- honestly, it won’t matter. You’ll catch up, and depending on the staffing of your clinic you may not even be doing it that often. I can’t remember the last time I drew blood; my technicians always pull blood/place IVCs/etc. Not saying your shouldn’t practice, but no one is going to ask you to demo your venipuncture skills in a job interview. 

Physical exam skills are where you should pay more attention. That will matter, and that is a skill to work on. Again, it will take time, but EVERY opportunity you have to put your hands on an animal, do it. Palpate bellies, listen to hearts, test reflexes, flex joints… work on building up an index of “normal” in your head so you can get better at picking up abnormal. Practice on your own pets. Get there early to examine all the inpatients/drop offs. Make notes and compare with the doctor on the case, then go back and look again if you missed anything. The part of your review you should take most to heart is the comment about needing more initiative. Your PE and assessment skills won’t get better passively- you need to push hard to develop them. But if you do that, you will gradually find yourself becoming more confident and competent.",Other

DiamondDry5638,"Annoys me the most? Clients, just clients. Stresses me the most? The entirety of being a vet.

""Try not to get suicidal and go take on an even more stressful night shift job that'll isolate you"", is a bad piece of advice. 

I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I also graduated in 2023 and have I've also been trying to get out of vet med entirely but there's not much out there except clinical practice, no matter what people tell you. 

I hated my first job so much, I had severe anxiety and panic attacks before going into work and actually got burned out after just 5 months of practice. My environment was super toxic. I finally switched and started at another clinic very recently, it's been so much better.

I made a similar post as yours a few months back and everyone told me to try out another 1-2 clinics before quitting, and honestly, it makes a difference. Try out something else with better mentorship if you think you're making bad decisions/diagnostics. After sticking it out at another job, if you truly hate it, then find an alternate path.

Wanted to be a vet since I was 3, graduated last june. I hate it everyday, I have always had a little bit of anxiety but always managed it and it never impaired on my daily life, but since I started working, I've been having severe anxiety every single day, imposter syndrome, scared of every little mistake/thing I forgot, scared of getting a board complaint and losing my license every other day. Most days I come home and stare at the ceiling rethinking my days or checking my files making sure no client called back and all the pets are fine.

WWoiseau,"Don’t take their trashy behavior personally. They are likely hardly educated and full of themselves. I used to be interested in vet med until I had a similar experience. The vet owners even tried to nip it in the bud by threatening to fire those with such bad behavior. As others have recommended, definitely bring it up with your boss. Otherwise find somewhere else and lay down your boundaries immediately. Stand up for yourself. It is not you. Sending so much love and hugs.

Vertigote,"How are they doing surgery without bw?!|Sorry I stuck my nose where it didn’t belong. Scrolling Reddit and ended up in vet subreddit. 

Both vets I see clinic policy is bw in last 30 days and Two emergency vet clinics do it too. I’m realizing it’s probably an abundance of caution and it means they can always check the bw results if I ask about a med or there’s more pain. It’s just easier than arguing with clients about whether or not it’s necessary before hand. Or afterwards, and getting them to come back. Us clients are harder to wrangle than the patients.

I think people jump on evidence that gives them something they can do, to control or improve, to be useful. And even better if it gives them something they can do that doesn’t require change and means they’ve been doing the right thing all along.|My podiatrist is aggressively insistent on brooks or hokas with super feet inserts. I’ve repeatedly broken bones in my feet, have arthritis and an inflammatory problem and bone marrow edema and my feet are just screwed. And while it’s painful still it’s now doable for me to be back to running 15 miles a week. Also compression socks. 
It’s incredibly useful for me to check in with a good physical therapist occasionally and have her check my posture, and how I walk. They can have me make seemingly insignificant changes like adjusting hip angle or engaging abdominals correctly. It took me from blindingly stabbing pain in my lower back to a full throb which is bearable. They can be magic workers.

It also helps me to freeze water bottles and roll them back and forth under my feet at the end of the day.

She bit a few people, damaged a computer, and the emergency vet had to verify she wasn’t actually feral. she got discharged early and they’d call me every 4 to 6 hours to check on her. They got gifts of makeup, nail Polish, coffee, anything that I overheard them mentioning they liked.  The robbed the bank part is what made me think of her. But that would be constructive with a purpose. I feel like my cat would try to burn it down and walk away.|I think people will continue with non compliance mostly but it’s helpful for them feeling confident about administering the med.

Omaze,"I agree with a lot of what you’ve said but they absolutely could not double their seats.

harpyfemme,"In my last semester of tech school, and I also feel this to no end because now we are subjected to all the ‘discovering emotional intelligence’ classes, and I’ll admit I can be a little awkward, I sometimes get myself in hot water because I just say what I think and sometimes say certain things that people who don’t know me interpret as me being rude. But my partner regularly tells me that a lot of people actually have very low emotional intelligence or social awareness skills and need to be taught how to talk to others, so maybe I don’t feel that I need this class, but other people CERTAINLY need this class. Like things like saying hello and introducing oneself and helping the client to be comfortable by saying even just ‘hi, my name is c, I’m going to be your tech taking care of you guys today’, a lot of people apparently just wouldn’t do that and would basically just ignore the client or just make them feel not included in their pet’s treatment, which as we all know clients don’t like to be ignored.",Other

This is a ChatGPT answer but it encapsulates what I was trying to say:

## Experiences to Help Become a Wildlife Vet

### Wildlife Rehabilitation Internships
- Engaging in internships with wildlife rehabilitation centers provides direct exposure to the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of injured, orphaned, or sick wild animals. This experience is invaluable for learning about the unique challenges of wildlife medicine.

### Research Projects
- Participating in research projects related to wildlife health, conservation, and disease can offer insights into the scientific underpinnings of wildlife veterinary medicine. Look for opportunities with universities, conservation organizations, or governmental agencies.

### Volunteer Work
- Volunteer with local, national, or international wildlife conservation organizations. This could include hands-on work in the field, such as habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and conservation projects, which can provide a broader understanding of the ecological contexts in which wildlife vets operate.

### Externships with Wildlife Veterinarians
- Seek out externship opportunities with experienced wildlife veterinarians or at zoos, wildlife parks, or conservation projects. These placements can offer direct mentorship and the chance to observe and assist in the medical treatment of a wide range of wildlife species.

### Continuing Education
- Attend workshops, conferences, and seminars focused on wildlife medicine and conservation. These events are great for learning from leading experts in the field, networking with professionals, and staying up to date on the latest research and techniques.

### Certification Programs
- Consider enrolling in certification programs related to wildlife medicine and conservation. These programs can provide additional specialized knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to a career as a wildlife veterinarian.

### Networking
- Build relationships with professionals in the field through networking events, professional associations (like the Wildlife Disease Association or the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians), and social media platforms. Networking can lead to mentorship opportunities and information about unpublished internships or job openings.

### International Opportunities
- If possible, look for international volunteer or internship opportunities. Working with wildlife in different regions can offer a broader perspective on global conservation issues and the role of veterinarians in addressing them.

### Academic Courses and Electives
- Make the most of your veterinary curriculum by taking electives or courses focused on wildlife health, exotic animal medicine, epidemiology, and conservation medicine.

### Self-Learning
- Stay informed about wildlife health issues, conservation strategies, and veterinary medicine advancements by reading scientific journals, following relevant organizations on social media, and joining relevant online forums and discussion groups.|Never had communication class.

This is a ChatGPT answer but it encapsulates what I was trying to say:

## Experiences to Help Become a Wildlife Vet

### Wildlife Rehabilitation Internships
- Engaging in internships with wildlife rehabilitation centers provides direct exposure to the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of injured, orphaned, or sick wild animals. This experience is invaluable for learning about the unique challenges of wildlife medicine.

### Research Projects
- Participating in research projects related to wildlife health, conservation, and disease can offer insights into the scientific underpinnings of wildlife veterinary medicine. Look for opportunities with universities, conservation organizations, or governmental agencies.

### Volunteer Work
- Volunteer with local, national, or international wildlife conservation organizations. This could include hands-on work in the field, such as habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and conservation projects, which can provide a broader understanding of the ecological contexts in which wildlife vets operate.

### Externships with Wildlife Veterinarians
- Seek out externship opportunities with experienced wildlife veterinarians or at zoos, wildlife parks, or conservation projects. These placements can offer direct mentorship and the chance to observe and assist in the medical treatment of a wide range of wildlife species.

### Continuing Education
- Attend workshops, conferences, and seminars focused on wildlife medicine and conservation. These events are great for learning from leading experts in the field, networking with professionals, and staying up to date on the latest research and techniques.

### Certification Programs
- Consider enrolling in certification programs related to wildlife medicine and conservation. These programs can provide additional specialized knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to a career as a wildlife veterinarian.

### Networking
- Build relationships with professionals in the field through networking events, professional associations (like the Wildlife Disease Association or the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians), and social media platforms. Networking can lead to mentorship opportunities and information about unpublished internships or job openings.

### International Opportunities
- If possible, look for international volunteer or internship opportunities. Working with wildlife in different regions can offer a broader perspective on global conservation issues and the role of veterinarians in addressing them.

### Academic Courses and Electives
- Make the most of your veterinary curriculum by taking electives or courses focused on wildlife health, exotic animal medicine, epidemiology, and conservation medicine.

### Self-Learning
- Stay informed about wildlife health issues, conservation strategies, and veterinary medicine advancements by reading scientific journals, following relevant organizations on social media, and joining relevant online forums and discussion groups.|Never had communication class.

There is nothing wrong with working on a different skill set, for a higher salary ,and building a different business. At the end of your life, you will not care if you worked as a vet or not.

This is a ChatGPT answer but it encapsulates what I was trying to say:

## Experiences to Help Become a Wildlife Vet

### Wildlife Rehabilitation Internships
- Engaging in internships with wildlife rehabilitation centers provides direct exposure to the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of injured, orphaned, or sick wild animals. This experience is invaluable for learning about the unique challenges of wildlife medicine.

### Research Projects
- Participating in research projects related to wildlife health, conservation, and disease can offer insights into the scientific underpinnings of wildlife veterinary medicine. Look for opportunities with universities, conservation organizations, or governmental agencies.

### Volunteer Work
- Volunteer with local, national, or international wildlife conservation organizations. This could include hands-on work in the field, such as habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and conservation projects, which can provide a broader understanding of the ecological contexts in which wildlife vets operate.

### Externships with Wildlife Veterinarians
- Seek out externship opportunities with experienced wildlife veterinarians or at zoos, wildlife parks, or conservation projects. These placements can offer direct mentorship and the chance to observe and assist in the medical treatment of a wide range of wildlife species.

### Continuing Education
- Attend workshops, conferences, and seminars focused on wildlife medicine and conservation. These events are great for learning from leading experts in the field, networking with professionals, and staying up to date on the latest research and techniques.

### Certification Programs
- Consider enrolling in certification programs related to wildlife medicine and conservation. These programs can provide additional specialized knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to a career as a wildlife veterinarian.

### Networking
- Build relationships with professionals in the field through networking events, professional associations (like the Wildlife Disease Association or the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians), and social media platforms. Networking can lead to mentorship opportunities and information about unpublished internships or job openings.

### International Opportunities
- If possible, look for international volunteer or internship opportunities. Working with wildlife in different regions can offer a broader perspective on global conservation issues and the role of veterinarians in addressing them.

### Academic Courses and Electives
- Make the most of your veterinary curriculum by taking electives or courses focused on wildlife health, exotic animal medicine, epidemiology, and conservation medicine.

### Self-Learning
- Stay informed about wildlife health issues, conservation strategies, and veterinary medicine advancements by reading scientific journals, following relevant organizations on social media, and joining relevant online forums and discussion groups.|Never had communication class.

There is nothing wrong with working on a different skill set, for a higher salary ,and building a different business. At the end of your life, you will not care if you worked as a vet or not.

I came from a research background before vet school and my classmates had way more practice in animal handling and clinical skills. So, I felt inadequate. In the end it is a matter of practice. You will get there . What you think you know now will be improved and honed in practice, especially in the first 5 years.

Being kind and empathetic is no small accomplishment and will serve you well as a clinician.Do not downplay this skill.",

That has historically not worked.  Switching to mobile data moves you to a different public IP, so connecting works fine then.  If you want to test that your own node is working, you need to do it from another network (like mobile data or public wifi at a hotel, restaurant, etc.). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xqf2ly/i_dont_know_every_time_i_am_trying_to_connect_to/iqczcmp/ | If you're connecting to your own node from the same network that the node is on, why are you doing that?  You aren't getting any benefit from the VPN at that point.

If you're trying (and consistently failing) to connect to different nodes, then that's a different issue.  It may be that your ISP or router firewall are blocking something. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xqf2ly/i_dont_know_every_time_i_am_trying_to_connect_to/iqhubfy/ | It depends on what your node is being used for.  I was top earner in the first month after main net went live, because I’m a US node on a gigabit connection, and people were hitting Netflix and Hulu through my node.  Suddenly, earnings fell flat.  At the same time, I started seeing content disappear from Netflix, and I was completely blocked from Hulu.  So, yeah, if you’re able to switch IPs, you might want to do it on a regular basis (don’t wait until the IP gets blacklisted, because then it’s just someone else’s problem).

Since I blocked Netflix and Hulu from my node, my earnings have been terrible, but I also don’t have to beg Netflix and Hulu to take me off their blacklist every month.

Also keep in mind that people have been using nodes to send spam.  My IP showed up on the spamhaus list a few months ago too.

So far, it seems like very little Myst traffic is legitimate; most clients either want to do something abusive or get around geolocation for content streaming.  I guess  I shouldn’t be surprised. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xeow68/should_i_change_my_ip_address_every_now_and_then/iojeru5/ | My router (Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro) gives me traffic breakdown per LAN IP.  Something like 95% of my node’s traffic was Netflix+Hulu. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xeow68/should_i_change_my_ip_address_every_now_and_then/iojqp9d/ | I'm not saying it's not legitimate.  I think it's very much a good use case for VPN.  The problem is that the content providers (Netflix et al) blacklist IPs if they think you're a VPN provider.  I'm on a static IP at my house (for reasons other than Mysterium), so having my IP get blacklisted means I can't use those streaming services for my own purposes (and, once blacklisted, Myst clients connected to me also can't use them).

&#x200B;

tl;dr: The reason I block Netflix and Hulu is because of the blacklisting policies of those providers. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xeow68/should_i_change_my_ip_address_every_now_and_then/iq43nxb/ | Assuming someone attempted to gain access to another computer on your network from your Mysterium server, that connection would have appeared to that computer as coming from your Mysterium server, not directly from the Mysterium client in NL.

&#x200B;

Now, if you are suggesting that someone, using your Mysterium server, logged into your router, set up a port forward (assuming your other computer doesn't have a public IP) to the other computer on your network, and then attempted to access it through that port forward, then, sure, it would show up with the Netherlands IP.  That seems like an awful lot of work to go through when they could have just done it over the Mysterium connection and appeared to be on your local network. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tgqjcv/network_attack/i16hvs4/ | 20% goes to the Myst team.

1) Having a residential IP in the US.

2) Having fast upload bandwidth (download is almost always at least as high as upload, so I just say upload here).

It seems that, currently, the vast majority of traffic (and hence, earnings) are from streaming video services that restrict content based on geoIP data.

1Gbps symmetric residential IP node is earning about 20 MYST per day.  I was making over 100 per day, but I think traffic slowed down across the board.  Note: if you have a residential IP in the US that clients are using for heavy streaming of Hulu, Netflix, etc., you may see that your IP gets flagged by them and no other streaming is allowed from that service.

Justgivemeanamethen,"Everyone here is right about this being toxic behavior. You need to have a conversation with management about it. 

I’ve worked with a lot of assistants and doctors (as an assistant and manager) in my time in clinics. My experience with this behavior has been this:

1) some assistants/techs are lazy and don’t want to do extra work. So when they say things like “no one else makes us do this” that sounds like lazy staff to me. They may like the other doc because she is happy to take short cuts and “create less work” for them. 

2) how do you act when you are stressed or overwhelmed? I’ve worked with vets who shut down, can’t make a decision, and get snappy when they feel stressed. Those types of reactions can cause the team to question competency. How do you respond when they offer suggestions when you’re stressed? I would get frustrated with vets who are clearly overwhelmed but unwilling to accept my input. (ex. recommending a vet stage other extractions when they are already behind, can’t get good dental rads and there’s a root they can’t get out. only for them to tell me they already got approval from the owner so they have to do it.) 

3) I’d much prefer a doctor do additional work ups than just take the easy way out. I can much easier defend good medicine that irks a client than bad medicine that causes problems for a patient. I think any good tech/assistant would say the same. I do get frustrated when the doctor can’t multi task through it. Are you able to delegate the treatment plan to them and move on to the next patient or are you involved in every step? I’d have some vets that want to draw the blood and start the tests when it would be faster for me to do it. You really need to have trust in them to do that. 

I have also seen staff members who love working with bad vets! Idk why! The one I’m thinking of specifically gossiped with the staff, used the R word several times (and didn’t understand why she couldn’t continue to use it after I coached her) and never bothered to read medical histories. I saw her do the dumbest things that came back with complications and they still liked her. All that to say sometimes the staff aren’t as smart as they think they are.

3) I’d much prefer a doctor do additional work ups than just take the easy way out. I can much easier defend good medicine that irks a client than bad medicine that causes problems for a patient. I think any good tech/assistant would say the same. I do get frustrated when the doctor can’t multi task through it. Are you able to delegate the treatment plan to them and move on to the next patient or are you involved in every step? I’d have some vets that want to draw the blood and start the tests when it would be faster for me to do it. You really need to have trust in them to do that. 

I have also seen staff members who love working with bad vets! Idk why! The one I’m thinking of specifically gossiped with the staff, used the R word several times (and didn’t understand why she couldn’t continue to use it after I coached her) and never bothered to read medical histories. I saw her do the dumbest things that came back with complications and they still liked her. All that to say sometimes the staff aren’t as smart as they think they are. 

I hope things change after you talk with your hospital leadership.|Everyone here is right about this being toxic behavior. You need to have a conversation with management about it. 

I’ve worked with a lot of assistants and doctors (as an assistant and manager) in my time in clinics. My experience with this behavior has been this:

1) some assistants/techs are lazy and don’t want to do extra work. So when they say things like “no one else makes us do this” that sounds like lazy staff to me. They may like the other doc because she is happy to take short cuts and “create less work” for them. 

2) how do you act when you are stressed or overwhelmed? I’ve worked with vets who shut down, can’t make a decision, and get snappy when they feel stressed. Those types of reactions can cause the team to question competency. How do you respond when they offer suggestions when you’re stressed?

Don’t feel bad about the money side of it because typically when animals come in that critical they’re going to be spending a lot more money (hospitalization, etc. it’s not usually a quick fix or OP procedure).

Papio_73,"I wish I knew about the animal research field sooner, I never perused being a vet tech as I didn’t want to work at a general practice. I am not in the position to go back to school but man I wish I knew then what I know now.|The same thing kind of happened to me; after working as a kennel assistant at a private practice I was sure working at a clinic was right for me: my boss is a personal hero and treated me very well but I wasn’t sure about settling as a vet technician as I felt this feel as I wanted something “more” after working in a clinic and aimed for general biology. I was hoping to become a zoo keeper but asides from the intense competition after working at a job (not related to animals) that didn’t give me a good work life balance and burnt me out (they made me work 12 day weeks and holidays while keeping me just under 40 hours so not to give me benefits) I wasn’t so sure about zoo keeping. 

I got a temporary position at a university and it felt like I discovered a whole hidden world, and it was nothing like I expected after growing up with “Secret of Nihm”, “Plague Dogs” and “Felidae”. I was heartbroken about not being asked to work permanently but I got a job as a caretaker at a smaller lab. I am studying for the AALAS certification test and am hoping to perhaps go back to school or get an opportunity to work with large animals and NHPs at a bigger facility. Just wanted to share my story lol",Other

One of my clinics ive had pretty good support, but they're informal with everyone, no Dr. gets referred to as Dr by staff except one practice owner.

The other one i've gotten some push back from assistants and techs because I stray from the way the medical director that they'd been used to from the last 2 years does things, she brought it up to me, I just don't care, it's what i'm comfortable with and I have contingency plans and am open to other opinions if my first tries don't take. I get both Dr. first name, and just first name, because its what i'm used to (oldest brother is a pharmacist and my dad was an ER doc, I don't like Dr. Lastname because its what they get too, it's weird to me).

Example, I tend to not immediately push for Tear testing / Fluorescein staining the first time I see an animal (she does) for a conjunctival issue (I offer it, but if i'm not immediately leaning toward using a steroid what would it change knowing that the pet has a tiny corneal ulcer / abrasion or not?)|You have to budget your mental energy

Example, I tend to not immediately push for Tear testing / Fluorescein staining the first time I see an animal (she does) for a conjunctival issue (I offer it, but if i'm not immediately leaning toward using a steroid what would it change knowing that the pet has a tiny corneal ulcer / abrasion or not?)|You have to budget your mental energy

Not all cases, but some are definitely not handled appropriately whatsoever, and by the time those clients can transfer to another ER, they’re running out of money.|As far as your question (why do we believe some papers and not others), I think it all just boils down to the fact that we’re human and have our own biases when it comes to what we think works and what we think doesn’t.

I’m an RVT and not a vet, but two of the four doctors I regularly work with still almost always dispense metronidazole for acute diarrhea on a negative fecal over probiotics/diet change. Why? Because it seems to work, at least in making the patient more comfortable more quickly, and thus the client is happier. However, when the tramadol papers came out a couple years ago (and I was only working with two doctors at the time), one doc kept dispensing it to his ortho cases while the other readily switched to other options. Why? Second doc felt that their patients had never seen much benefit from the tramadol anyway, and he was keen to not have to deal with dispensing a controlled substance. First doc felt like it did work for a lot of his patients and didn’t mind the controlled drug bit, until more papers came out verifying its lack of efficacy and he decided to switch to other options. 

Despite doing our best to remain impartial, sometimes we stick with things because, well, we think they work and/or it makes our lives a little simpler/easier. Definitely keep an eye on any new studies coming out that help verify findings because studies aren’t always infallible, but if this is the one bit of medicine you can’t seem to sway from because it works for you and your patients and you don’t have sufficient evidence to prove that it’s not the best choice, then keep on keeping on.|I’ll be honest in that I’m biased more toward metro working for acute diarrhea cases over not.

Wasn't sure how people would prefer me to restrain, and I swear I had to ask everyone else to place catheters because I just couldn't get them in. Now a little over 3 months later I've found my footing. I have no problems with catheters, picking drug protocols for anaesthetisia, giving advice and helping the newer nurses. 

The key to getting better is tackling the things that you find the hardest. I placed IV catheters in all the surgical patients every day until I got better.

Even for the more experienced vets, my practice estimates 1.5 hrs (total anesthesia time) in case things are messy in there.

I have (so far) only torn one cat pedicle in my surgical career and that was from trying to autoligate. I’m sure there’s a happy medium between me neurotically double ligating and triple checking things before letting go of tissue versus rushing through and having ligature trouble.

The toxic behaviour not so much. My class sued a couple of our profs, I think, and got one thrown out of the classroom for sexual harassment, though he kept his job. So it has been done.

Goldinshaur,"Im from mexico, i used to be a medical doctor (oncology), it has been quite of a ride!, its also difficult to be a specialist but if you rich it is so well paid!, i had to move to canada with my husband and they want me to pay a lot and do all over again, so i decided to study and make something different that i always  wanted, if you want to study to be a MD or a Veterinary or even a nurse in both fields in mexico my only advice is to decide where you want to live and develop your career because not all countries revalidate that easily your background.

If you like your actual job, maybe having a side hustle can be a good option or move to another country that can easily revalidate and bring you great opportunities with the knowledge and certifications you already have.",This comment falls under the category of a Medical Doctor.

LaS0mbra_,"Search for more errors in the node log... That seems to be a DNS problem, try doing a ping to see if your device recognizes that address (ping location.mysterium.network, ping lookup.mysterium.network). If ping does work then you know there's nothing wrong with the ports. If not then there's a chance that DNS doesn't recognize the domain name, if that's the case u could try to link the domain name location.mysterium.network to the IP 51.158.204.30 (ALWAYS check if this IP is the same as the one location.mysterum.network is at for your DNS. It is for now, but if it changes you should change it as fast as possible, so check regularly, to check you can try [this page](https://dnschecker.org/domain-ip-lookup.php).


I've had this kind of issues before, a node requires maintenance and keeping it updated is basic. Main errors are my DNS resolver for my node does not work so not even ping google.com worked, in my case it was because the symbolic link to resolv.conf was broken; other common error was ""couldn't find device ifb0"", which I could solve by scaling perms to some processes; some other errors I had were solved by simply waiting, restarting the node or restarting the machine (yeah, the classic ""turn it of, wait and then turn it back on"")... I currently have my node offline bc I use it for other purposes as well and requires some time to keep it up with no errors. So I can't help much rn as I would need to test possible solutions in my machine.|Strict NAT (most probably strict cone NAT type) is not a good choice for this type of services. NAT comes from ""Network Address Translation"" and works at the IP level of any communication. The Cone restricted NAT won't allow translations through the same port of entry and exit (I'm not good at explaining this very accurately but you get the idea), therefore your clients cannot establish a stable connection and most of them will reject the attempt as they'll try to listen to the response through the same port they sent the message through.

So basically it is like me knocking on your door and you saying whatever through your window. I won't listen to you as I'm focused on you opening your door (or using the door phone) and speaking to me through that mean. I'll eventually give up trying after my timeout jumps even if you responded that I'm allowed to do the connection. The graphic would look like this:

.......[Your device]

\               | same port (conflict)

\           [NAT]

\             /  \ different ports (cone)

\         [c1]  [c2]

When c1 tries to connect through port 40404 the inner device recieves that through any other port, if you are lucky (or have forwarded the ports to a range of portso) such port is listening to the connection and will send an OK through another random port in range. C1 will be listening through the same port 40404 and will have other ports closed or in use, leaving your response to be lost.

Now that you know this, the best option would be to use a Symetric cone NAT or a full cone. You can try binding the ports and allowing port forwarding, you must forward each entry port from n to n and vice versa for exit rules.


About securing your stuff... You have many ways to do that. Creating a DMZ, blocking specific ports and directions coming through your VPN device (such as incoming traffic from 10.x.y.z to 192.168.0.1 admin, careful with this as you don't want to be left outside to and brick your router, you'll have to reset it otherwise), etc. I have done that by a 2 level connection network. My first level is my main router that will lead me to the internet, then that one will be used as switch to create two subnets, one for my device with mysterium and another leading to a secondary router with a pfsense firewall in between. My secondary router can listen to the interface of my main router and my secondary subnet, however if you try this the other way you'll be blocked. 

There is no such thing as the perfect security, but I don't think you'll need more than that unless you are a multinational grade company with thousands of million dollar worth information. You can also use encryption protocols that aren't obsolete and that will be an extra layer of security.

Ask more specific questions about this last part to specific subreddits such as r/netsecstudents or r/cybersecurity|Uhh... Never heard of this one. I believe some streaming services can block an IP if they detect it is a VPN provider, however this is VERY unlikely to be the case. Can you provide more details about this issue?

When c1 tries to connect through port 40404 the inner device recieves that through any other port, if you are lucky (or have forwarded the ports to a range of portso) such port is listening to the connection and will send an OK through another random port in range. C1 will be listening through the same port 40404 and will have other ports closed or in use, leaving your response to be lost.

Now that you know this, the best option would be to use a Symetric cone NAT or a full cone. You can try binding the ports and allowing port forwarding, you must forward each entry port from n to n and vice versa for exit rules.


About securing your stuff... You have many ways to do that. Creating a DMZ, blocking specific ports and directions coming through your VPN device (such as incoming traffic from 10.x.y.z to 192.168.0.1 admin, careful with this as you don't want to be left outside to and brick your router, you'll have to reset it otherwise), etc. I have done that by a 2 level connection network. My first level is my main router that will lead me to the internet, then that one will be used as switch to create two subnets, one for my device with mysterium and another leading to a secondary router with a pfsense firewall in between. My secondary router can listen to the interface of my main router and my secondary subnet, however if you try this the other way you'll be blocked. 

There is no such thing as the perfect security, but I don't think you'll need more than that unless you are a multinational grade company with thousands of million dollar worth information. You can also use encryption protocols that aren't obsolete and that will be an extra layer of security.

If your IP is blocked you should get in contact with Disney's customer service. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/18fs6il/content_providers/kcxw66e/ | Seems like there's a problem with the perms from the client side (your side). I cannot solve the problem with the current info (maybe someone that's more sharp with networking can, but I cannot), however I can try to make a trace explanation of that error.

Before I begin, I apologize if my explanation is kinda messy. My native language is not English and for technical explanations and descriptions I'm still pretty clumsy:

Seems like you cannot create an interface TUN, that interface is usually created by default by VPN applications. In this case wg (wire guard) is attempting to create a TUN interface to send the p2p request (similar to an http handshake request). Therefore the lower layer (transport) cannot establish the connection to attempt the handshake and finally establish an application level communication.

The important thing here goes with the interface. An interface is like a ""tag"" or the ""name"" that a device gives to a certain connection. Let's say that is like areas with their own ""traffic laws"". Each interface will be able to communicate with other interfaces with certain restrictions or won't be able to do so. The two most common interfaces are LAN (local area network) and WAN (wide-area network). LAN is supposed to be your ""trusted"" interface, you trust whoever is in your house with your router because you much likely know them. Hence LAN users can ping to each other and ping the other interfaces such as WAN. This is a terrible explanation but it works for you to understand what interfaces are for. They are restricted areas for your devices and you can set the rules from each interface.

Ok now TUN interfaces. Those are interfaces usually generated by VPN programs to set certain rules like ""hey, this is a tunnel interface, no one is allowed to send nor receive information from this interface except for you and the peer"" (peer 2 peer, only both ends will be able to receive and transfer data, with asymmetric encryption that doesn't allow one peer to ""snoop"" what the other peer is sending, therefore your data will be encrypted even for the other peer, and vice-versa). It's an interface that has certain rules to allow the VPN connection. If those rules are not set then the peer will reject your connection as you are sending a normal internet connection to a VPN peer. So if your device is not allowed to create interfaces or the mysterium app doesn't have enough perms to create the TUN interface you'll be rejected by every node. 

You'll either have to configure a TUN0 interface manually or give perms to the specific user/application/device. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/14if2b6/this_error_message_is_being_displayed_whenever_i/jpgezek/ | Then the problem is the other peer. The node might not be well configured or not enough connections could be made before it reached a time out. That's my guess ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/14if2b6/this_error_message_is_being_displayed_whenever_i/jpgkkhj/ | There are several ways to control network traffic. I believe there's a whitelisting option in the node options. However you can have even more control over this. Using traffic rules in your router and networking your LAN side traffic. 

For example, I don't want people to have access to my LAN side clients and I don't want them to ping my broadcast to see what clients are up. You can either block ICMP packets from your node and/or create two separate networks and setting the routing table so that only your ""LAN_trusted"" network has access to your ""LAN_node"" network but not the other way around, with this you can access your node via ssh (always recommend to use PSK auth if you leave ssh open). In my configuration I have two subnets and I block any connection from ""LAN_node"" side to my LAN and also any TCP connection to sensible ports, for example: DENY INCOMMING FROM 192.168.0.240 TO 192.168.0.1 PROTO tcp -p 80. This denies traffic from my node in 192.268.0.240 to the admin page of the router at http://192.168.0.1/ (is a fictional private IP, my node is not at that address and my priv IP for my router is not the default gateway 192.168.0.1). For obvious reasons I don't want external traffic to be able to access my router admin settings trying to get my user and password.

Once LAN side is properly secured you can use rules to block unwanted webpages or use the router settings for only whitelisted traffic (many routers have this option and use blocklists to avoid unwanted traffic) also using s good blocker and firewall such as piHole or pfsense helps a lot. piHole can be used as your DNS and you can add as many rules as you want to it. It's unlikely that mysterium whitelist fails to contain such traffic, but if it does so you'll have many options to control what goes in and out your network. 

If there's something you don't understand or that you don't know how to configure just reply and I'll do my best to try to explain it with more detail. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jloxjse/","Based on the content provided, the comment would fall under the ""Other"" category as it does not relate to being a Medical Doctor or Veterinarian."

FrostyMeowmeow,"I had a similar feeling when I first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after I graduated college, and it took a year of ""soul searching"" to figure out what I wanted to do with my career, as my degree was in general biology with a pre-med track. I decided medical school wasn't my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine, but also the concept of zoology.


I shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics. I finally got a job, and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging. I vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week, ""What the hell did I get myself into?""


The learning curve is STEEP, but you'll learn to celebrate small victories. It's okay to feel as if your client interactions don't go smoothly or if you could've done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure.

My first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner. During my last year of clinics, I realized the world of medicine is MUCH MUCH MUCH more profound than it appears. I'm finishing my last year of specialty training (almost four years post-doc). The further you get along in your training, the more science you incorporate into clinical practice.

I decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it's not GP. GP practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume, are expected to be jacks of all trades, and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors. 

I'm fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies. They do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist. Internal medicine is still very client-heavy interaction. However, remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front-facing interactions with the public; you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team, and depending on where you do your training -- students. Specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest, but also part of the pre-clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities. These aren't things to worry about just yet -- you'll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling.

Take it one day at a time. It will be hard, but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face, knowing that you've made a difference in somebody and their best friends' lives.",Other

https://github.com/steccas/myst-manager

It is meant to create a manager if you have multiple nodes but also create its own node. Probably you don't need to spin up everything in there. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/stks60/possible_vps_node_runner/hywfhkz/ | Yeah, I just spinned it out with port forwarding using docker.

I have traffic running on it.

I just had to open the oracle firewall ports ofc. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/stks60/possible_vps_node_runner/hx5xdf1/ | Have you opened iptables ports?

You don't even get a separate IP device (ie. wg0) so even applying fw rules or a IPS is difficult.

Also node analysis is really bad, some integration with tools like grafana would be great, here again a separate ip dev would help a lot.

This is not plug and play solution.

EDIT:

Try to fill in an issue here: https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvjtt94/ | Hi! Yes I did open because I was having a lot of doubt.

In the end it's not to bad, and using docker can let someone achieve even host isolation, but even in this case an added layer of security with the right settings can be achieved.

Also, I think that better work to prevent bad traffic FROM the node can be taken.

I'm working in creating a stack with a filtering DNS, IPS and some filtering rules.
And ofc better monitoring integration.

I think in general that they are steps to let the project to become a better product.

I'm happy to read that you solved your problem anyhow and thanks for the details given :)

I will create a repo soon for node deployment. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvosgyf/ | I do really agree with all your points!

Containerization in general is essential in these cases, it's easier to use and just secure by default. Even in professional, enterprise environment it is my way to go.

They should really do as you suggested, propose it as a suggested config. The container + firewall trigger solution would be already way better.
Of course help from external firewall is even better.

How did you block the webui? A rule using the container ip/subnet itself? What about the container localhost?

On this regard I was working on some egress rules to prevent attacks, scanning, etc. Wich rules did you use? You have some suggestions?

In my case, I'm not going to run nodes in a home network/home lab environment, I'm not comfortable with that.

I'm running them hosting/vps etc. So in all cases each node will have it's VM. Even in this case, I'm still deploying with docker, but in some cases this can create problems with NAT... So host network should be used, but in working on that.

Now for these VPS I'm trying to filter as much traffic as possible using iptables/ufw, for now I'm blocking the usual bad packets (XMAS et al) in the outgoing chain. And as you pointed out I was trying to disable the webui access from the VM completely. To access it I'm planning to use SWAG (a Nginx proxy with certbot and fail2ban), then, to avoid other rules etc it will not be accessed by VPN but with a zero trust access like the cloudflare one (this should hide the IP and set up strong authentication to the webui).

Next steps as I already stated is, DNS, IPS, Monitoring.

In this case a dedicated VPN could be better.

For this in planning to:
- instantiate 2 pihole + unbound in 2 vps/nodes or maybe one per node. With good lists.
But maybe the first solution is better.

- Then grafana should be centralized as uptime Kuma.

- Suricata on every node to filter egress attack.

- Heimdall or another dashboard with all the nodes ui links using SWAG Proxy.

Especially points 2 and 4 would have me inclined to use a dedicated VPN. in this VPN nodes will reach the DNS.
Individual nodes web ui will not be exposed, so there will not be a proxy on every node but just one, the latter will be protected by zero access and could allow to access the nodes webuis via the VPN.

While this solution is fairly easy to implement using docker (also easy because the big services are central and not one per node) really good FW rules will be needed for the VPN.

In any case I thank you for the insights, the suggestions you're giving and for volunteering to help with the repo.

Regarding that, I'm planning to publish a bare public repo to work on, (just need to make the small things I did a little bit more presentable) 

It will be open so everyone can contribute.

Looking forward to read your opinions. 😊 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvrtajr/ | Dang, for some reason my answer isn't here!

The rules are very good indeed, you did perfect isolation and took measures to stop common attacks. I suggest stopping malformed packets and limit-rating syn and pings. (I've put your rules in the repo)

For the UI you are right, and I think is pretty much well defended by default.

Yes I'm working on 2 repos, soon I will make them more presentable and maybe create a post ahahhathe internet via the node, his identity will remain unknown.

&#x200B;

You're very very good. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwe3h1t/ | Hi and sorry if I took some time!

To be honest you did a great job, I'd just add blocking of malformed IP packets and rate limits for SYN and ICMP packets.

The more services you find that could be blocked the better, and that's what you did!

Blocking outright all the internal network is great also.

Regarding traefik, I think it is way better to stand with nginx, and especially swag that has fail2ban integrated.

I found that port 4449 is pretty closed off by default. So that's good.

&#x200B;

On the VPS vs ISP: I honestly think that they are still monitored in any case.

But being the user already connected behind the myst VPN is identity is already protected.

&#x200B;

Also Im about to push 2 repos, but I'm not sure if the DNS will be useful; because I didn't understand wich DNS will be used by the VPN client ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwe587j/ | HI!

\[never tried to do that with Proxmox's firewall\]

It may be that it does it by default... but only egress.

\[doesn't need reloads or rebuilds\]

True!

\[failtoban...\]

Yes but it does serve a different purpose, it's light and is just a layer of security.

\[from my ISP's point of view becomes an indecipherable mess\]

Yes... but I am just too concerned in the ISP just reporting all this traffic that I don't control as mine.

\[DNS\]

Yes but I read that the user can choose which one, so if it is automatic he would use the node's one? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hx18vj1/ | Wow, how did you attract this amount of traffic? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hwe27s4/",Other

It’s one of the most difficult years because you always feel like you don’t know enough, aren’t good enough and you are assessed on everything too! Plus studying for the NAVLE in any spare time you have kills your brain. 

I really resented school at the start of final year because it meant taking time away from my son. The only comfort I can give you is that they are little and won’t remember the time apart. But if you finish this degree, you could work only a couple of days a week and have way more time with your kids when they will remember it. 

Is it an option to get a nanny to help out a few nights a week so that it doesn’t all fall on you husband? I think an investment in some help around the house/with the kids will give you the strength and sanity to continue and you can easily pay back the amount you spend on help now. We ended up getting a cleaner to come every two weeks and it helped immensely.

hawthornehopper,"I did two internships and a residency. I needed years after my training was over to start to feel “normal” again. My physical and mental health were both markedly affected. I have so much more I’d like to say but I’ll finish with - this needs to be published. Please submit it! Maybe JAVMA or even Vet Record just to get it out there!|I would strongly recommend choosing a specialty practice like bluepearl (or I know Medvet has a similar program) so you can get closer experience with not just ER but the specialty services as well. I do not think you need an internship to get proper mentorship and I do agree that, if you have no plans to specialize, these programs seem to make a lot more sense!","This comment should be classified as ""Veterinarian."" The mention of internships, residency, specialty practices like bluepearl and Medvet, ER, and specialty services all suggest a background and experience in veterinary medicine. Therefore, this individual falls under the Veterinarian category."
Lopsided-Switch-8404,"My partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship. I'm in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture, especially when you first join the profession or work at the ""elite"" level. 

Working long hours because you are in a complex, busy, and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me. What is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians. Some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession, and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment. So many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of ""it was hard for me, and so it should be hard for you."" The point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor, not training, patient care, or gaining experience.

This internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns (e.g., an intern can't have more than X number of inpatients at one time; hours limitations related to overnight shifts; etc.) that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis. For example, after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner's inpatients. My partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients. This happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything. This is a common occurrence.

Senior clinicians have said blatantly racist things that the interns are afraid to report due to a culture of retaliation.

There's an in-house social worker who has repeatedly expressed concerns about intern well being and a culture of abuse and exploitation, and those concerns have been brushed off by leadership repeatedly.

There needs to be more oversight of these programs and actual consequences for programs not adhering to their own rules.",Other

To answer your question, and I mean this in the kindest, most respectful way, I think you should ask your husband. What does HE need after a long hard day?

Matttyyyyy,That's good to hear! I know you guys have to be careful with copyrighted material so puts me slightly at ease. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/px1xg6/isp_concerns/heknhqo/,Other
VaranusCinerus,"I can answer a couple things-
Cost is prohibitive and honestly $25-50 per user would depend on the clinic; ie how many staff? What is their average profit to work with? A small family owned clinic is going to have less to work with per employee than a larger facility. 

Also - we switched at my place and despite all the troubleshooting... we had issues with various things. For example ALL avian patients ended up with no species - it deleted all species and age info for avians as they were input differently. Any labwork also didn't get changed over that had been uploaded.|Yeah it's extremely subpar and why our management put off switching until it became absolutely necessary when we went fully paperless- the old system just.. wasn't set up for it
I am the one uploading all the old files at my practice, and it is at the point I am manually updating all the avian accounts as I upload, and if owners need an appt before I get to their file we have to explain the issue and ask them the needed info, as there was no other fix- and this takes so much time I could be using for actual animal care and helping the techs and assistants more, but is critical to have patient info correct 

If you are able to make something better, that would not be cripplingly expensive & works better than those on market I would expect some success after it's proven to work at the first batch of places but definitely would have to find clinics willing to hear you out and try first - would advise you try to start by either lunch&learns when you are ready to sell as that is what the ones we have used do, or looking into veterinary expos to get the word out once you have something together.",Other
f4un4,"great advice in this comment section so far! for context i am a ""lead"" veterinary assistant. i essentially got this position by being a jack of all trades at my hospital (we also don't have many CVT's haha, otherwise i am sure there would be a lead technician). don't undervalue things like reception and customer service. learn both the front of house (reception) and back of house (technician) operations. 

honestly it is evident that you are eager to learn-- make sure that your team can also see this same enthusiasm! you are going to do great!  now, not every moment can be a ""teaching moment"", i ask questions as much as i can but i also learned to read the room and know when it was inappropriate for me to ask questions, and rather just help how i can, which frequently means simply restraining the animal and/or monitoring. there is going to be a lot to learn and it will feel like a lot at once, just know that there's definitely a learning curve and you will totally get past it. with each day of experience, you will get better (even if you don't realize!). sure, there were some things i had to go out of my way to study but a lot of what i know came from experience and getting used to the routine of the clinic.

learning your flea and heartworm prevention is huge imo, helping people understand that fleas and heartworms actually can enter gated communities (yup, somebody said that once) and understanding which kind is best for their lifestyle. obviously, follow the guidance of the dr. but frankly techs and assistants have a LOT to do with client education as well, as typically we are the ones who go over patient histories and treatment plans/estimates.

i would also say it is important to learn how to run labs pretty quickly. no one is going to be expecting you to place IV catheters or do blood draws on day one, but to be able to go run things on the machine and/or read the cytology will be super useful. 

one of the few things i had to really study as opposed to learn through experience was the drugs used during surgeries. pre-op/induction drugs vs post-op vs emergency drugs. mainly what you need to know is how what drugs the vet uses will affect your patient, for example some cause bradycardia, some cause them to wake up really hard, etc. this will be important to know if you are monitoring patients, which, not to worry, I don't think they will throw you into!!

anyway, sorry for the yap fest. this is an awesome job and an awesome field. it is hard, don't get me wrong. but you will connect with so many pets and so many people. i am at a point where i have a rapport with pets and their families and it just means the world to me.|i am so happy to hear that your cat made it <3

Icy_Beautiful8312,"What are you struggling with exactly? It's not always a matter of volume, sometimes you need to prioritize efficiency when it comes to grades because there's so much to do and little time|It's a better idea to actually experience vet school before deciding on these things. Before vet school I hated cardiac physiology, never really understood it and just sort of assumed I'd go into surgery because I'm good with my hands. I'm currently in vet school and I fell in love with cardiology, hematology, oncology... Surgery is literally my least favorite subject. I'm definitely going to be pursuing internal medicine as a specialty, and I would never have imagined myself doing so before actually taking the classes. Be patient, and explore before you commit to anything, and remember you don't necessarily have to commit to anything at all! You can be a GP and that's great as well.",Other

Commando_Hotcakes,"Had a dog booked in for a dental procedure and removal of some skin tags. It arrived on the day and when asked about the skin tag locations the owner said ""Oh, you don't need to worry. I'm a dentist, and some friends of mine are dentists and surgeons, we removed those easy peasy the other night when we got together for drinks.""

Never seen the vets roll their eyes so hard. The owner had made such a stink about those skin tags and made the consulting nurse's lives hell. It was ridiculous. 😑",Other

I don't think it's a skill issue given I could clear NAVLE on my first attempt while I couldn't clear the job screening tests here even after nearly a decade. It would be easier if I had a caste based reservation since all my caste benefit batchmates could secure a job within 0-4 years of passing out. Rest, one needs heavy political pull to secure such employments in my state (province). 

My mere frustration with this system lead me to apply to get a vet license outside of this corrupt vicious circle.

And yes, about the pension. There's none now so..|So I thought as well. Was in for a rude awakening after getting navle scores.|Not much true until you open your clinic in a metropolitan. I have multiple friends who have opened their practice in small states near their homes but they are yet to break even after 2 years of opening. They're paying rents out of their own pockets most of the time.|🤷|What's the salary for neutered one?

Solerian,"Yes, I think my favorite thing is getting them to trust you and understand you’re just trying to help them. It breaks my heart to see them fearful and anxious from past experiences. I always try to give them lots of love (and treats if possible)!|Definitely market yourself as someone excited to learn and willing to stay in the field, not just someone who kind of wants to do it. Lack of experience is hard because lots of places instantly reject if they see you’re without experience. If they won’t take you for anything, try interning or shadowing somewhere and see if you can eventually make your way in.

JonLivingston2020,"I'm a Ph.D. neuroscientist with a serious interest in medical matters and comfortable with terminology.   I research my pets' conditions carefully and observe their behavior closely.  I don't tell a doc or vet about my education or what I have done for a living.   That said, both docs & vets pretty much pick up on it the moment I start speaking.  I can tell by their demeanor.  Maybe once or twice I've had someone talk to me in a way that felt patronizing, but most speak to me as an equal and I appreciate that.|That's a toxic and disrespectful environment if you ask me.   Having the rudeness to actually say such things to your face?  Even if they were true, and they obviously are not. 

You either need to quit or to come up with some snappy come backs that will put them in their place.   Maybe it's a weird initiation rite of some kind.  Inappropriate but things like that do happen.|Interesting to note that this is getting worse at a time when something like 80% of veterinarians are female.  At least, where I live.|It may have nothing to do with it.   Your supposition appears to be that I'm claiming the abusers are female.   IMO it could go either way, but if significant numbers are, then it would argue against the claim made for years, that if women were in charge of the world everything would be sunshine & bunny rabbits.  OR ... if it turns out that women are predominantly the victims and the abusers are the last holdouts of the previous generation (mostly male) then that would merit a big write up in the NYT at the very least.|Maybe learn radiology.   If I were younger I'd do that career now.|The best thing a witness can do is dial 911 and let the pros handle it. 

If were a super emergency, such as a fire, I would run in and try to get a person out or douse the fire.  But the pro's would rather people not help if possible because you might give them another injury to deal with.|Is your practice flooded with clients?   Seems all of them are in my area and that's got to be stressful.|You might enjoy reading an old classic:  ""All Creatures Great & Small"" about a young vet who takes a position with a crusty rural vet in England.   You are experiencing what all professionally trained people do.  I have a Ph.D. in neuroscience and oscillate between thinking I'm the smartest person in the room and being convinced I'm a hopeless loser.  It comes with the territory, when a person has high standards.   Just breathe & take it one day at a time.|Yes|Yes that is terrible.  In my area where cost of living is high, tech positions are being advertised at $19-$30 per hour.   I paid a software programming intern $30/hour back in 2006.    And techs are so important to the whole client experience (moreso these days when most vets do the entire workup behind closed doors and only speak to the client for 10 minutes at the end).|Still, it's unfair.   Software programmers with undergrad degrees start at $130k in high tech.   Less education and far less importance in my view.   Vets should get more, but the problem is the business model.  Human medicine is underwritten by a vast insurance network & massive government subsidies.   High tech is flying high on sales.  Both have $$$ to burn.  Vets depend alnost 100% on a client paying their bill.  I'm sorry that's the case.  Pet insurance is not underwritten by employers and far too expensive for most people.|Well I hope you get it and I hope you receive the appreciation you deserve as well.  :)|Your answer makes no sense.  I did not say ""vet med is far less important"" I said it's more important.   Yo.  Dude.|Nobody knows that better than I.  I have a Ph.D in neuroscience from a premiere university.   Haha.  But your definition of “worth” is shallow and dehumanizing.|Fact|Clients complain a lot and some have switched to other providers.|I was hopeful for your situation, until you said the part about senior vets telling you that you're bothering them.  That is workplace abuse and would never be tolerated in a reputable outfit.   It's unprofessional and unethical to take advantage of junior people.  Please start looking now, if you can.   Best wishes!  The vet professional is SO IMPORTANT.  You're a good one and the animals need you!|That has got to be the hardest thing in veterinary medicine.  I'm sorry the workload is so high you cannot grieve.  Every death is a loss whether your own pet or someone else's.  You're a wonderful person and I hope you will find a way to process the grief(s) as they happen.|Consistent with my experiences in the past 5 years.|Sorry to hear this.  You've landed in a toxic work situation.   If it were the other techs I'd say you were going through ""initiation"".  But if it's the doctors then believe me if they're yelling at you they're yelling at other people.  Maybe the reason you got pushed into the new role is because they can't keep good people.

3DPvetguy,"Currently in vet school. Hard as hell but well worth it. It is a very good market for graduating vets with GPs making great salaries.|I think it’s a very interesting opportunity. I’m pro-owning for sure. Valuation is very difficult because you probably don’t know how much the practice profits and the owner takes in yearly. Typically practice valuations go as a multiplier of the previous 12 months profit. 4-6x is pretty standard. Any higher than that is difficult to justify without significant opportunity to grow or add services. It’s one of the reasons corporations have been able to buy so many practices. They can afford to overpay, 8-10x profit for example, because they have deep pockets and they’ll make back the money by cutting costs or decreasing salaries. So it’s tough to say in this situation without knowing typical profit. I’d say anywhere between 8-20% profit is typically where most practices sit but there are outliers on both sides. So if you gross 5-6 M and profit 20%, then the valuation isn’t as crazy. If you profit 8% then it’s absolutely wild. 

As for partners I think it’s very situational. You can also organize it in different ways. Maybe you take a lead, pay more and have a larger portion and therefore more decision power. I also don’t see a huge problem with 4-5 equal partners with equal say as long as there is a good contract with out-clauses for each partner. Owning a practice can be an opportunity to set yourself, and your family if you have one, up for life financially.

It is a very good market for graduating vets with GPs making great salaries.|I think it’s a very interesting opportunity. I’m pro-owning for sure. Valuation is very difficult because you probably don’t know how much the practice profits and the owner takes in yearly. Typically practice valuations go as a multiplier of the previous 12 months profit. 4-6x is pretty standard. Any higher than that is difficult to justify without significant opportunity to grow or add services. It’s one of the reasons corporations have been able to buy so many practices. They can afford to overpay, 8-10x profit for example, because they have deep pockets and they’ll make back the money by cutting costs or decreasing salaries. So it’s tough to say in this situation without knowing typical profit. I’d say anywhere between 8-20% profit is typically where most practices sit but there are outliers on both sides. So if you gross 5-6 M and profit 20%, then the valuation isn’t as crazy. If you profit 8% then it’s absolutely wild. 

As for partners I think it’s very situational. You can also organize it in different ways. Maybe you take a lead, pay more and have a larger portion and therefore more decision power. I also don’t see a huge problem with 4-5 equal partners with equal say as long as there is a good contract with out-clauses for each partner. Owning a practice can be an opportunity to set yourself, and your family if you have one, up for life financially.

inigomontoyajoke,"Went to Purdue. Some clinicians are good, some are nasty, and same for techs. I bet I know which clinician complained about posture! My first rotation they told me I talked too much and wasn’t serious about vet med (elective rotation). Second rotation they told me I talked too little and was too serious. But ultimately I did get a great education there. Edit: not to say that this is the only way to get a good vet education- it’s not. Also this does not excuse or negate the bad parts. Would have been a lot better if clinics didn’t make me nauseous some rotations 

I wish I could say it’s different in other vet schools but doesn’t seem to be the case. Have a friend who went to Colorado with similar stories :/|Honestly most of the senior clinicians were reasonable and helpful. Some of the residents were not great. It was well known that some people would fail a rotation because of a resident. Repeat the rotation, different resident, they would get As (the inconsistency and the judgement based on if someone liked you was frustrating). I had one block where the resident hated me, got a horrible mid block review, and by sheer luck ended up working with a different resident the rest of the block, and got told that I improved so much…
By the same token, there were some nursing staff that were awful to people. There was a lot of favoritism there. Sometimes I probably benefitted from it. Overall I feel that most of the staff there was good, but there were a few that were truly unfair and seemed to have a lot of power in the reviews. I also received very few criticisms of my clinical skills or knowledge. Literally 95% of the negatives they had were about my personality. I think it’s because they felt they had to mention something (it wasn’t just me; a kid a few years ahead of me got told his smile was creepy and another girl was told she was too happy), but I came out of it thinking everyone hated my personality and dreading reviews. Then my rotating year, literally every review (which I would be so nervous about lol) was like “people love working with you. You do a great job!”",Other

prettyhippo,"I’m in the U.S. 

I’m currently Executive Director of a rural animal shelter. I do not have a degree or certification. I literally just worked from the bottom to the top. 

I volunteered at a different animal shelter. 
Then worked at a doggie daycare. 
From there, I got hired at the shelter I volunteered at and worked my way up to assistant manager. 
I left that shelter to work at a veterinary hospital as an assistant. I was lucky because that hospital would train assistants on: exams, reception, lab, and surgery. 
I left that job to start at the shelter I’m at now. I was hired into a management position and then was promoted to ED. 

It is possible, though a lot of it was luck and being at the right place at the right time. Get as much experience as you can and credible references.|I’m in the U.S.

ARatNamedClydeBarrow,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I’m losing one of my new grads and I’m super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn’t have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.|I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER. I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients don’t want to listen.|As a VA, this makes me so sad for you.

* You will no longer need to stake MYST to run a node, and
* Rewards will be paid in MYST instead of DAI.

The question I have is:

**WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF STAKING MYST?**

In the original model, MYST had value because you needed to stake it to earn rewards on your node. If you didn't have enough MYST, you could borrow it from the delegation pool. Now, in the new model, you can stake MYST, but there is no reason to borrow MYST. ~~And what is the source of interest that you earn by staking? Does this come from the stash of MYST that the mysterium founders have?~~ In my opinion, staking and the delegation pool make no sense in the current model. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wwp5kg/to_enhance_rewards_for_our_community_of_myst/ilpk7ag/ | Concerning the origin of the interest paid to stakers, the post says 

>Delegation Pool rewards will be generated from Mysterium’s collected   
network fees (Hermes smart contract fees), and redistributed to those   
who stake in the Delegation Pool

However, I still don't understand the purpose of staking. Stakers offer NO BENEFIT to the mysterium ecosystem. Though I will be happy to receive staking rewards, stakers are simply leaches.

As a node runner, 10% of my earning are taken as fees. A portion of these fees will go to pay stakers, even though stakers don't do anything and are not needed for the system to work. Perhaps this will introduce scarcity of MYST because people will buy MYST just to get a portion of the network fees, but, this is completely artificial. We simply don't need stakers in the revised 2.0 model. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wwp5kg/to_enhance_rewards_for_our_community_of_myst/ilpl4em/ | Thanks, I did read the FAQ. The node runner UI also says something similar

>""Safe option: traffic vetted via business contracts and unavailable to the general public. This option potentially will give less reward.""

What I am asking is: What kind of traffic is this? Is there any risk at all that my residential IP will be blocked from places like Amazon, Netflix, etc? Or is the traffic entirely benign with no risk whatsoever? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wuy5hx/what_is_mysterium_verified_partner_traffic/ildbv2z/ | I am using pihole on a raspberry pi as a recursive dns resolver. You can install this on the same pihole that is being used for myst. After doing this, you just click on the traffic coming from localhost to see what myst is doing. This is not foolproof, because in the myst client, you have the option of choosing which dns to use. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wuy5hx/what_is_mysterium_verified_partner_traffic/ilkfjcm/ | I totally agree with what you are saying about the risk. However, I think that I am asking a very reasonable question that the Mysterium team should be able to answer:

**If I presume that the verified partners are all good actors, what kind of traffic are they using my node for? Could this result in being banned from Netflix or Amazon?** ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wuy5hx/what_is_mysterium_verified_partner_traffic/ilkf2a5/ | But you still haven't answered my question: Is the traffic all data scraping?

mmx38,"Thank you! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tb8039/mysterium_service_fails_could_not_get_hermes_url/i05koem/ | I am running my own vpn separately already. The purpose for my request was mostly to be able to verify the normal functionality of the node and maybe further security. This is why I mentioned that the traffic should not be counted.. to make sure that mode owners won't try to generate extra traffic.

Is requesting speed test on Discord an automated process or someone has to do it manually? If I want to do speed test every 3 hours.. is someone willing to do it? If I suspect there is a problem with my node now.. how long will ot take before someone performs the test and how long can they be there for further trouble shooting?

Currently my total earnings are < 0.01 MYST which is around 0.00336122 USD right now.  This is after 114 sessions.   


I figured the following issues might be to blame:  
1. Raspberry PI 3 B+ doesn't have enough resources to be a solid node.  
2. There are too many nodes in my area.  
3.  Whitelisting just doesn't give you that much traffic.  
4. There is some unknown setting I'm not seeing.

A reason to access countries with less traffic is if you want to get into the local news, or info. some sites are geolocked so you must be local to view them.    Pay attention when accessing from the UK and you'll probably realize your news feeds are hand fed to you based on where you are.   Those are the best examples I can think of off the top of my head. | I'm running two nodes in different locations, and noticed the overall amount of traffic has been less lately.  Last few months have had up to a week with no traffic, then short burst of traffic, such as over a weekend.  Could be the number of nodes coming up on the network.  The more nodes there are, the less traffic per node..  unless there is an increase in users to match.   You also might be in a currently less desirable location, which could change day to day. Politics, ISP rules, Network laws...  all changing worldwide on a daily basis.     So in short, not just you. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1c6zfac/node_runners_earnings_dropping_significantly/l04urhr/ | I've always seen wild swings on my nodes, so it isn't surprising to me and nothing new.  They tend to go through some dry spells then pick up again.   I hadn't considered the Android nodes coming up, but it seems like they would have little impact on node traffic outside of areas with really good mobile coverage. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1c6zfac/node_runners_earnings_dropping_significantly/l0llhho/ | I cannot see into the inner workings... but I can tell you the devs don't control the market.   I've run a node and used the MYST VPN.  You load the VPN software up front by buying MYST tokens from any exchange you can get them from.  You actually can find and chose a node in a good location to connect to.. so you are directly connecting to the node you are using and paying that specific operator in MYST tokens.   When the node operator cashes out by transferring the earnings to a wallet,  there's a fee for that, so I suspect that is when the devs are getting their cut.   But that is separate from the many connections made that node. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1bm7crt/is_the_mysterium_network_really_decentralized/kxsl7sy/ | Have you tried logging into the GUI on a node rather  than just the dashboard?

Have you received MYST he to the same wallet before?  and do you have any MATIC/Polygon in the associated wallet?

If no MYST received to that wallet already, cannot verify correct and working.   

Might need to put a small amount of MATIC in there to make sure the wallet address is functional and activated

I've seen issues where token balances were not visible until there was MATIC in the associated wallet, that might be your situation. 

Of course always double check address for accuracy. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1be3msl/as_a_myst_node_provider_through_kryptex/kusakv2/ | Mine has done that before, still not sure the exact cause, but a system reboot fixed whatever it was. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1baa0m9/country_list_isnt_loading/ku3snhm/ | Power cycle or restart whatever device you are using, when it loads fresh it may clear up whatever the problem was if something was hung up. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1baa0m9/country_list_isnt_loading/kvavmgv/ | Did you login locally to your node and check the address for payout is correct? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1ax7h7o/hello_what_should_i_do_i_did_not_receive_my/krm4ait/ | Depends on their purpose.  If browsing the net with a lot of graphics and videos, it is bandwidth intensive.  But if they are trying to access something that is text only for example, it will be barely measurable in bandwidth.  They might not even be using a browser for connection.  The web you know has only existed since the 90's... before that web pages were not a thing, but the underlying internet has been around much longer.  Unix Gopher commands come to mind, it only goes out and digs up the data that is purely a string of text.  Would barely be measurable by today's standards, but still in use.

A VPN is useful for all net connections, not just web browsing. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1ax4qs3/anyone_else_have_someone_random_from_germany/krlu16x/ | Not going into much more detail than my previous comment, but I can think of a whole list of uses that would barely use any data, so doesn't surprise me at all. 

I doubt it is your average web user connected. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1ax4qs3/anyone_else_have_someone_random_from_germany/krlz9tp/ | I've sometimes had that happen after a reboot, if everything else is set correctly (and I yours was since it worked before.. )  just leave it on for a while, sometimes it takes several hours to a day to correct itself.        Any time I change something that requires a reboot, it does that again, but even without monitoring, I was able to verify it was still working by going to the local login and seeing users online.

At one point I contacted their customer service about it, they said it was fine and to be patient for the monitoring to be seen by the website.  So that matched with my experience. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1atwib1/anyone_know_why_this_happened_i_just_installed/kr3lsiv/ | I'm running my node on a Windows system, that is also a server for other things, if I open the task manager and check all processes associated with Mysterium, they don't even add up to 40 MB, so you've got plenty. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/18yn16g/node_on_512mb_ram_is_it_enough_to_run/kgf8gtx/ | Not all searches are web browsers or video.

You may need to check with your ISP to know how they are connected or routed. 

The Mysterium system doesn't control your shown location, it is only picking up what is shown by your connection. They cannot control that from their end.  Since it is your internet connection, that does actually make you the client for ip2location. 

They MYST nodes don't produce quickly, but steadily in my experience.  Best ways to improve your earnings is to open the Node UI and make sure all 3 toggles are turned on. (Public, B2B VPN and data transfer, B2B data scraping)  Also keep the node running 24/7 to allow users to connect at any time.  If you lose your connection an active user will go to anther node and you lose them as a customer.  In short, keep all services on and keep availability as high as possible. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/13iwovz/1_question_about_increasing_myst_earnings_and_a/jkcz7x1/ | Restarting didn't work, but waiting a few hours did.

The internal UI shows the proper balance, just isn't showing on the dashboard.

in the NodeUI in the ""transactions"" section, there is a ""Settle now"" button next to the balance. I don't use it though.

Edit: Showing properly now, seems was probably a temporary glitch. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/130b5kt/dashboard_vs_node_ui_balance_discrepancies/jhwlcw3/ | As of today, mine started this same behavior too. Replying to let anyone here know that it isn't an isolated problem.

Temporarily disabled antivirus just long enough to download it, and install  (no other windows, browser, or anything else open)

But that won't prevent viruses, that's not how they work.   If one attaches to the Brave executable for example, it would run whenever you start brave.exe in any user profile. 

I've not encountered it, but it is known that many anti-virus programs will identify anything related to crypto as unwanted. 

This is happening because a few unscrupulous people hide the miners inside other programs, essentially stealing someone else's resources to mine with,  so the antivirus sees them as acting like a virus..  and when it sees the same signature when not hidden inside another file, it still assumes its a virus, when in actuality it is what we want to run. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/12esxbg/mysterium_is_a_malware/jhbnr7a/ | You're a lifesaver, was trying to figure that out after setting up a node incorrectly..  now if I can just figure out how to get MYST added under Polygon instead of Etherium to actually have a new address, I'll be set. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11s41em/change_wallet_address_native_windows_node/jgv5ltu/ | I prefer to avoid metamask (I have my reasons)..

I've heard nothing but bad things about this school for clinics and glad to see it's always been the same|Hahaha can’t wait

Purdue was my last choice and I guess I got the shit end of the stick, it is what it is

I just hope it can’t get any worse than it already is in my mind|That's exactly what I've been telling myself. I don't think it has changed much, even though they've built all new facilities they're really fucking understaffed and I've been hearing from current Rossies there that the techs are absolute cunts to the students. I'm sure it's just a shitty culture they have there that's existed long enough to just never change. 

In the end I know I'll be a really fucking good vet no matter what anyone tells me and I couldn't care less what bitter unhappy people think of me|Oh I agree 100% I say that now to feel better about myself but when I’ll end up in the situation itself I won’t be able to keep my mouth shut.

I want there to be change to this field and I’ll do my part when the time comes. Will it bring to meaningful change? Probably not but I don’t want to be part of the problem like you said and at least try to do what I can to make it better|That’s honestly crazy to hear, I definitely don’t know the extent of bullshit going on there then|I did vet prep in fall ‘21 and now I’m about to head to clinics in 3 months.

awfullogic,"following ! i’m a first year also interested in cardiology :)|i mean, euthanizing an animal that doesn’t need to be euthanized vs doing it to end suffering is a completely different ball game. one of them is for the benefit of the animal, and one of them is for the benefit of someone else. pet euthanasias are always sad, but i can’t imagine putting down an animal that doesn’t need to be put down, especially a baby. it seems normal that would cause psychological distress, and if it didn’t i’d be concerned. and no, it’s not unprofessional to show emotion when you’re euthanizing someone’s pet, as long as it’s not to the point where it becomes about you rather than the pet owner. a lot of owners would prefer a vet who shows that they care through a little emotion vs. one who is stone-faced and emotionless.|in this day and age, we have lots of in vitro models that could be used as substitutes. for human medicine, somewhere between 50-99% of animal studies fail to predict human outcomes; that doesn’t seem like high enough yield to outweigh what these animals have to go through. the euthanasia is the most peaceful part for them unfortunately. i know you said you aren’t interested in it anyway so it may be a moot point, but i just figured i’d point out that it’s not necessarily true to say lab animal usage is needed for the advancement of science.|unfortunately, most meat farms are not like this, as they are giant industrial facilities that care more about production and profit than animal welfare and “reverence”. regardless, slaughterhouse workers have some of the highest rates of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. killing an animal that doesn’t want to be killed will always be psychologically distressing, regardless of how much “respect” is shown, unless you have no empathy for other living beings.|not sure why you got downvoted, people don’t like to hear the truth i guess !|totally agree with what everyone else is saying! the time will pass anyway, so might as well become a doctor in the meantime :) i’m 24 and just finished my first semester of vet school and most of my classmates are around 22-27, and there are lots who are older too, so you’re definitely in the majority. in terms of relationships, if i’m being honest i haven’t really had time to think about starting one! at least in the US, vet school kinda takes over your whole life, so thinking about relationships have definitely been put on the back burner for people who aren’t already in them when they start. one recommendation is to date people who are pursuing graduate school or similar degrees as well. for example i’ve been on dates with people from the medical school nearby, because they understand better than anyone that school comes first! best of luck and congratulations 🫶|at my school, you have to pass each block with a 64 or higher, and usually each block has 3-4 exams + a final. if you fail, you can either take an “advancement exam” which is basically just a test on all the material and if you pass that you can progress to the next block, or you can elect to restart the block next year with the following class (i.e basically take a year off and try again).|sending thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to you all 🫶 at my school we have an exam every 2 weeks and just one cumulative final at the end of each block",Other

EngineeringNo1848,"Vet school with kids is so hard! My daughter was 4 when I started school, I graduated last May. I found 3rd/4th year rotations to be the most challenging by far.

Plus the added stress of studying for the NAVLE, which I recommend taking a block off to study for if you haven't.

irregardlesslike,"Yes, there is a dress code and they review it during orientation. For current vet students, it’s neat and clean. Jeans, leggings, skirts, pants and dresses are all good but will depend on what you’re doing that day. Closed toe shoes or otherwise appropriate footwear for the day’s activities. 

Avoid shorts, gym clothes, ripped jeans and beachwear. You’ll be in scrubs or overalls for some rotations. Orientation week is business casual, I believe. 

If you’re on a campus tour and not accepted yet, wear business casual. 

Edit: yes, it’s enforced.

In Mexico (where I'm from), there is an oversaturation of small animal clinics and hospitals in the cities, but most of them offer poor benefits and salaries, and starting your own clinic is not that easy. Because of this, and the situation in the US and Canada, many recruiters are looking for DVM graduates from my university because we are accredited by AVMA|I think used ""doctorate"" referring to ""PhD""|Hey! I'm in the same situation. I don't have too many references with small clinics, but I've read that Banfield is offering around $100k/year plus production and a signing bonus for new grads (I'm not sure, but I think it's around $35-50k). I'm not sure if that's the average situation, but small clinics are offering a signing bonus of maybe $5k to help cover NAVLE, visa, and relocation expenses.|I appreciate your comment.|I appreciate your comment. Wish you the best in your new job!|I'm from Mexico and going to take the NAVLE in November/ December window. I just read a bit about Vetco, and opinions seem to be mostly similar|Oh, thank you! I'm going to take a look|That's correct. I'm Mexican and studied at FMVZ-UNAM. I had some schoolmates from the US and other countries, and I believe the tuition per year for foreigners is around US$1k, with living costs ranging from US$350+ per month, depending on your personal needs. They also mentioned that it was quicker since we can start right after high school without needing to go to college first. It's a 5-year program plus 6 months for social service, and the time it takes to complete your project degree (around 6-6.5 years in total).

I would like to hear about your personal experiences with the requirements and the cost of university. It would be very interesting considering that these are very different situations, especially for Mexicans who study at UNAM, where tuition fees are very low due to being subsidized by taxes (which is why the acceptance rate to this university is extremely low and it has around 250k students in different majors and campuses). It's crazy that with 1 US dollar, we could cover the tuition fees for the 5 years of veterinary school for 243 students (25 peso cents per year per student).

I'm planning to take the NAVLE next year.|Do you already pass the NAVLE?
I know some companies working with Mexico to bring vets to the states; maybe you can find something similar for the UK. You can also move to Canada; the only thing that I think you'd need is the NAVLE, but you have to research migration requirements. Additionally, you can use LinkedIn, apply with some companies, and see if they can help.",Other

https://youtu.be/xGHY2oOun34?si=j0-hqV1l0-0RFvdc|Thank you!  You are the first person to not assume I'm a new grad. (I am, though).  However, I'm also interested in practice ownership where I will bring on new grads and also will be receiving my first appraisal soon where I have exceeded my benchmarks.  I put a lot of work into doing well at this job and I know my employer is pleasantly surprised that they didn't take the financial hit that they expected to. I would like to know how much I've saved them by exceeding their expectations so that I can advocate for myself during my appraisal and not rely on my employer to tell me what they think.

Some people may not be a fan of this, but this isn't my first career and I firmly believe that people need to go into appraisals with a firm understanding of the value they bring to their organizations. If my company negotiated a $100k salary expecting to lose $20k my first year and I exceeded $100k, then from my negotiating point, my original salary should have been $120k.  For the entire first year, I took a large hit whenever I took PTO as that is based on my salary and not production while they avoided losing the $20k they expected to on my salary.

(BTW, this is not a critique of my employer as I understand that we both entered negotiations with an element of risk and I wouldn't begrudge them for using the data they have available which influenced their first and subsequent offers. I've also made up numbers for these examples. Ultimately, I was very happy with my negotiated salary, but if I exceeded the expectations, then I want to go into my appraisal knowing that and not rely on them telling me.)|It absolutely should be a concern. As a new grad, my employer negotiated a salary based on the assumption that I will not meet production goals my first year.  If I do make or exceed them (as I am now) then I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made come time to negotiate future salary.

I also disagree with your opinion about pro-salary in your first job.  It may not be for everyone, but it has done well for me.|Full time, SA GP no ER/urgent care. I understand there are lots of variables at play, but employers definitely have an idea in mind when they negotiate salary for first year grads.  First year's are limited to the salary information they receive from recent grads and the school/AVMA reports... the employers, especially corporate companies have a lot more data to use when calculating a starting position for salary.  I just want to know what the employer expectation is.  I know they anticipate losing some money on a new grad w/ pro sal and chalk it up as an investment.  I want to know what investment employers are comfortable making.  Do they make a $100k offer expecting the new grad to only make $75-80k?|&#x200B;

>new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.

Exactly! So when I negotiated my salary, I negotiated in the dark with no idea about what my prospective production numbers would be.  However, I'm sure my employer had a pretty good idea about what they expected me to earn since they have access to lots of information about what first year grads make. And that's what I want to know. I'm happy with my salary.  However, as someone who exceeds my benchmarks, I want to know how much more I made the company than they truly expected me to make my first year.  That way, when I get appraised soon, I can advocate for myself.

I'm sorry if you can't comprehend that a person can simultaneously focus on improving at their job while also calculating how much their effort is worth to their employer. I work for a company that makes money off the work my team and I put in.  We deserve to be compensated appropriately and if my salary was originally negotiated lower than what it should be, then I am within my right to fight for a fair salary.|Thank you for the answer, but I didn't ask how much I should be bringing in to meet my production benchmark, I'm trying to find out how much employers expect new grads to bring in.  I'm exceeding my benchmarks as is, therefore my employer is not taking the loss on me that they undoubtably expected to when they hired me.  I would like to estimate how much that is so that I can best advocate for myself during my appraisal. 

For example, say most new grads miss their production benchmark by 20%.  Then my company hired me at $100k expecting me to only earn $80k my first year.  The 20k difference would be the ""investment"" they expected to make in me. However, if I work hard enough during my first year to exceed my salary benchmark, then my employer didn't have to take that $20k hit for hiring me as a new grad. It means we negotiated a salary too low to begin with.  I would like to know that with quantifiable information as my hard work has made my company more money then they expected so that I can appropriately advocate for myself during my appraisal.|Thank you! I understand your point here, but what I'm looking to calculate from my question is a little different. 

It is well established that employers expect to take a loss on a new grad their first year as most don't meet the production break even point to pay for themselves in the first year.  Employers generally chalk this loss up to the investment cost of a new grads to make them efficient and competent enough to make or exceed the breakeven production goal.

I'm in the position where I am already exceeding production goals, through my own investment in myself outside of work to learn, grow, and develop efficiencies. Therefore I would like to calculate how much I've saved my employer by them not having to take that ""new grad"" hit.  For example, if my salary is $100k + 20% pro sal, then my break even point is $500k.  If my employer only expected me to make 80% of that, then they really expected me to earn $80k of my salary ($400k production).  There would be a $20k hit to them that would be written off as training.  However, if I make or exceed my production, yes I do get my contractual payment, so I don't ""lose"" money, but I also have saved the company from taking that $20k hit they were expecting.  I would like to know what that amount truly is, hence wanting to know how much employers expect of new grads.

As I prepare for an appraisal, it is important to know my worth in a way that allows me to best advocate for myself.  Having my production numbers is one way to do so, however knowing what I have really saved the company through my performance and additional work outside the office allows me to maximize my leverage.|I don't doubt your experience, but from everything I've been taught and experienced the last 6 years it seems things may be different now.  Every employer rep (private and corporate) who came to talk to us in school about negotiating salary stressed to us that they don't expect new grads to make production during their first year (which is why they recommended that we always ask for no negative accrual).  Even when I first started with my current employer, they highlighted several times that they didn't expect me to make or exceed my base and once I quickly started to they were genuinely surprised.|These are valid points and you are correct that I wouldn't rely on this information as the sole grounds for requesting a salary adjustment.  However, I would argue that there is value in knowing how you performed compared to how you were expected to perform in a quantitative manner.  I'm sure if I underperformed compared to how an employer expected me to perform, they wouldn't hesitate to bring it up to me.",Other

Accomplished_Coat231,"You can either take the shadowing route described by the previous poster, apply as an assistant if you do see a job open up that doesn't require experience (sometimes places like Banfield will train someone from square one), or do what I did and volunteer at an animal shelter to build up some animal experience to list on your application.|Oh, or most clinics will hire kennel assistants without experience. Then at least you'd be getting paid. Once you prove yourself to be a good employee, you can see about transferring to the assistant position.|They're going to want to see evidence that you are reliable (show up on time? not call out for frivolous reasons?), have good common sense, and plan to stick around for a while. They're not going to want to invest time training someone then have them quit a week or two later once they learn that kennels are noisy and there's lots of poop to clean up.

To prepare, think of a few examples of times in the past where you've demonstrated responsibility, stuck with something despite periods of difficulty, or shown good observational skills that helped prevent a problem.

Business casual dress would be something like khakis/slacks and a nice shirt or sweater.

fijititis,"I'm 16 years old and as of this past year I decided on my career path. My big dream is to travel around the world and work with wildlife, specifically doing emergency surgery or surgery in general. However I understand that may seem unrealistic due to the competiveness of this career, so at the end of the day i'm keeping my options open. 

 I do have a long-term plan to help me move towards my big goal, however I feel like there is so much more I can do right now that I don't know about. 

So here is my current plan and how it's going;

1. I'm graduating highschool early, sometime within the next couple months. Due to this, I plan on starting classes at my local college until I can transfer to a 4 year university. Then, I will get a bachelers in bioligy. (I still dont know much about college, so any tips PLEASE give.)

2. To start off my career with some early expeirence, I volunteer with my local shelter. As of now I just work with the animals on the adoption floor, however soon I will begin working with animals post-surgery. Sometime around next month, I plan to apply to a simular program at my  zoo. Both will allow me to volunteer regularly for the years to come; because most places wont allow you to volunteer until your 18. 

3. Next week, I plan on applying to any jobs nearby that work with animals. I really want to start off in a vet clinic, however almost every clinic I have seen needs prior expierence and you must be 18. So for now I plan on applying to dog daycares, or something along those lines. 

TLDR; is there anything else I can do to help get myself started? Is there anything unrealistic I should know about my plan? Is there a chance i CAN begin working at a vet clinic at my age? please give your thoughts about it even if its rough.",Other

So I assume this project is killer protocol for enabling ""big-block hidden service"" for many cryptocurrency. BitcoinCash(*1) and Tezos(*2) would gain massive benefit because they're planning scaling strategy witch is expecting that mixnet's average bandwidth will be bigger than now. And they're focusing on other target first.

user191514251,"Thank you to everyone for your support, and for sharing your experiences, for those of you wondering, I am looking in to getting it published somewhere like AVMA or DVM360 so stay tuned for that. I will probably respond to a couple commenters individually, but I have to say that hearing your stories breaks my heart. I know that a lot of people, including myself have experienced a lot of trauma from this system, but it still shocks me what some of you are sharing. I hope this turns into some kind of tangible change for all of our sake.|I am looking for anonymous testimonies to strengthen a case for change. I know so many of you have a story to tell. If you can, send me a testimony of what you have experienced. It can be as short as a few sentences, or as long as you would like it to be. It can have specific stories or just how you feel. Also include an anonymous name you would like to be referred to as. These stories are invaluable to me. Like I said in the letter, “it is much more difficult to ignore a tide of shared trauma than one individual letter,” and I think it is very clear that there IS a tide of shared trauma. You send me a message here on Reddit or send it to my email (user191514251@gmail.com). If any of you are not ready to share, I totally understand as well. We are all at a different point in this journey.|I’m very sorry that your partner has to experience this. I am also sorry that you have to watch it. There are few things worse than watching someone you love be abused and not be able to do anything about it.|Human medicine, from what I understand, only has to Match one time (not including fellowships, etc.). Their internship is more equivalent to the first year of a veterinarian residency. We do not have to same luxury in veterinary medicine, and you are correct, internship does not in any way guarantee residency.|I am so glad that you had this experience, it is encouraging to know that good programs are out there! I think this shows the advantage of determining a fair system of checks and balances: the good programs will have to change little. Again, thank you for sharing!|While I’m sure it would be helpful for many to have the names of those residency directors, I can guarantee you they are not the only ones doing this, which is crazy when you think about it. There is a dark underbelly to this abuse of power.|Abuse, exploitation, and mistreatment are bad for the veterinary specialties, as you have outlined here. Many people avoid specializing to avoid abuse, justifiably so. A fair system would encourage better learning and would revive interest in specialization.|The “too weak to cut it” narrative is one of the most common, and it functions to maintain abuse on multiple levels. It shames the person who is experiencing the abuse, either causing them to ignore their mental/physical/emotional/financial needs, or to quit their program and admit their ‘weakness.’ It also serves an example to all those witnessing that this is the culture.

I want to be clear, if you leave your program for your own well-being, you are not weak. It is a lie meant to keep people in place they do not want to be.",Other
thornbeary,"I have similar worries about graduating. When I was a tech, we had a couple new grads, and we tended to trust them and only intervene if there was an obvious medical error in the works. But I feel like I’ve recently been seeing a lot of the big vet/tech humor accounts making fun of “baby doctors” recently, esp on tiktok, and it’s making me nervous. I want to be friendly with my colleagues and to be able to make mistakes without worrying about them writing me off as a clueless new grad, especially if that’s going to become more of a stereotype. 

And since people are getting hung up on the title part, it’s definitely cultural. I work in our teaching hospital, all of the doctors are “Dr. Lastname” or just “Lastname,” unless they explicitly ask to be called by their first name (usually interns and residents). Before school, I was a tech at an ER where we called all of the drs Doctor, even if it was just “Dr. B” or “Dr. Emily” instead of a full formal last name.

I was made to see a therapist for ""my problem"".  (So they have been doing that for a while). I admit there was a shit rolls downhill attitude,  and it took a while for me to learn to help with students who were afraid of me as well.

Just to see if that sort of crap was still happening.  I hoped it was better. Also to see if I could finally get my intern certificate( I still havent gotten it, even though it was promised 3 or 4 years ago)  The part that really infuriates me, is that a I found out a  surgeon there was really against my doing a surgical residency- even though I had been told multiple times I was very talented, and did a lot of solo surgery there- and that he had done the same thing to other african american candidates.

If it wasn’t in Ohio, I’d consider moving back there to work and raise my family. I only explored part of their vet schools but what I saw was pretty nice. The buildings look relatively updated, nice study spaces, separate from main campus but within walking distance so you don’t have to deal with a lot of undergrads if you don’t want to. Teaching hospital is nice from what I saw but I only ever was in the SA ICU. Overall ranked #4 top vet school. 

Started my vet journey at Ross and 2/10 don’t really recommend for many reasons. 

Now at KSU and loving it! Supportive faculty, administration, staff, classmates. Great DEI program that is ever expanding. We have a clinical skills lab every week for the first two years in which you learn anything from animal and surgery skills to business and financial and communication skills. Many clubs who have cool wet labs and lectures. A city zoo ten minutes away and an exotics ward in the hospital. Coursework isn’t any worse than Ross at least and grades tend to be better here. NAVLE passing rates continue to be way above national average. Don’t know too much about clinical year and house officers but it doesn’t seem like they’re overworked on most rotations. Clinicians that I know have all been respectful and supportive. My only grievance is that Manhattan is much smaller than I was used to in undergrad so I miss being in a big city. There isn’t too much to do here and you have to drive 1-2 hours to get to larger cities (which still aren’t very large IMO).

Look into counseling services at your school. Many schools have them nowadays for free.

Vet med is about improving human lives by caring fir the medical needs of animals.  Like preventing disease in food animals.

If you are doing it for the animals, the people attached to them will drive you crazy.",Other

squeaky-beeper,"I remember HATING those classes especially in first year. I can also say that they are the single most helpful class I took in vet school.  Miscommunications and hurt feelings will escalate any situation. If you’re able to communicate well and handle upset clients, it’s going to save your ass from a report to the board. 

I would also point out that crying doesn’t mean the class is bad. It means it’s a deep and painful topic for some people. And I’d rather vet students work on that in school than be blindsided out of school

I would try to look more into why you’re angry about the class. Your response is just as valid as others who start crying. I had to do the same thing and it was worth it in the end.","This comment should be classified as ""Veterinarian."""

If you go to school in a state that doesn’t require you to be a certified vet tech, I’d say you might want to consider taking a part time job during the semester. If you can pack all your classes into 4 days, that gives you a full day to work and maybe pick up a shorter shift on the weekend. It can be a lot, but honestly, I’ve been doing that every semester where I work on Fridays, and I love the change of pace and it’s a nice end to my week. But if you do this, try to find a place that’s accepting/accommodating of students if you can. I’ve never had a problem taking time off to study for midterms or finals since my boss really values school and tells me to put it first. But I’ve had friends tell me how they had a lot of trouble getting PTO to take an exam that falls on a day they are scheduled for, even when they requested that day off long ago and their schedules come out weekly.",Other
SprinkleOfWisdom,"Sure you can. I’ve worked with a small animal vet who then worked at the zoo a certain day of the week. So, you could work as an exotics vet and work with a certain zoo. Not all zoos can afford to have a full time vet. Also a lot of specialists might get called in to help at the zoo. Zoo vets are often huge generalists, so they often might phone in for advice from specialists - even human MD specialists. I saw that especially with primates. Possibilities are there, it just may limit some of your location options. The most important thing is to know there are options and focus on vet school, building good relationships, and trying different experiences in vet med. You may evolve your interests too which is great.|I'm a veterinarian in the US, so while I don't know the details of veterinary school systems internationally, I can say with confidence, that I would recommend shadowing several different types of veterinarians as well as the other roles inside of the veterinary practice including on the business side such as the practice manager. Observe what they do. Ask them what they like and dislike about their job. What would they like for their career path? Ask what they wish they knew or had done when they were your age. Never put all your opinions into one person. Take what they say and apply it to what you seem to enjoy and your values. Have fun and stay curious about possibilities. :)",Veterinarian

KnockNocturne,"The thing that really got me through my first semester was; don't compare yourself to anyone. You are sitting in a room with some of the smartest people from across the country (and world) so it's natural for there to be some crazy balance adjustment. 

Also, no matter how much the school might tell you that your goals shouldn't be just making it to the end of the semester--fuck that, sometimes that's the motivation you need to keep pushing cause as you've already learned it ain't over til it's over. 

The best thing you can do, you're already planning on doing. Changing what doesn't work, and finding what does work is incredible knowledge. Additionally, don't get hung up on any of it. If it's not helping, throw it away--don't keep it because you know it helps your friend and maybe one day it will help you.

panic_ye_not,"Interesting. I also don't know how I got to this sub, because I'm a dentist lol.


But in dentistry in my area, I think most dentists go by ""Dr. _____"" with their staff and even with other dentists unless they're personally close. Shortly after graduation I even told people they could call me by my first name and they still called me Dr. ______ because the norm is already so established in most offices I've been to. 


So if I introduce myself as Dr. ____ to staff or tell them how I want to be addressed, and they ignore it? That's not only unusual, it would be an open insult---that is, in my situation. 


I'm not sure if there's a similar culture in veterinary medicine in OP's area. It's an important ""if"" to consider. ",Other
Unhappy_Passenger_86,"As some one who is also coming from a difficult situation and trying to pursue vet school, I have the greatest amount of empathy for you and your situation. I had my son my sophomore year of college and being practically homeless made it really difficult. I worked full time, took care of my son and just tried to barely survive. My end GPA at my undergrad school was 2.89. so I completely understand that low grades can be hard to come back from. 
I share this because I have gone on to get waitlisted at a vet school and this year I have again gotten interviews and a chance to go. Look at each vet school before you write yourself off and see what their requirements are and how they calculate GPA. I put mine into a Google doc so it was easy to read. I then looked VERY critically at my own academic experience and matched all the classes I had taken and their grades with the prereqs of each school.  A lot of schools (not all) out more weight on last 45 (semester credits, 60 quarter credits) than on overall GPA. If you can show in your last 45-60 credits that you were able to turn your grades around, it makes a really compelling case for you GPA wise. As for the DUI, I would be honest but not overly ""woah is me"" when it comes to discussing it.  They are not robots and the admissions people are generally awesome to talk to. So go into it with a growth mindset. ""I messed up, but here is what I learned and how I am taking steps in the future to keep it from happening again."" 
Diverse experiences and lots of hours will also help your case. If you look at your experience and see you don't have large animal or research, try to find ways to really get as much variety and length of hours as you can. I work in the research field, so my hours there number over 10k, but I had never worked in private practice, so I called every vet practice I could reasonably get to and found one that let me shadow. If you love wildlife, get involved at a wildlife rehab place and show that you really do want to be in that field, or become a zoo volunteer. Your past is only a fraction of who you are. Spend the vet school application showing them who you are now, and take steps to prove you have what it takes. Best of luck to you in your current and future endeavors! It's a hard road, but you are never without hope.",Other

Due to me having so many internet scrapers, as soon as I turn on mysterium DVPN, they all shut down (selling my un-used internet bandwidth, I'm optimizing that set up for a few weeks now... its all working and banking well.. and like everything else you can set up various nodes in various locations/ip addresses to scrape internet to sell lol even with using raspberry pies, they can be used to sell internet connections too.

Decay_kun,"Should I pursue a DVM if I struggle in math? Bit of a background. I have always had a delay in math. Throughout my HS,MS and ES years I have always struggled with math. In HS I barely passed with a 61 in Algebra and on Algebra 2 I did not pass and had to make up credits, I did okay in Geometry (79 and that was the highest grade I've ever gotten in math) and currently have a 77 in my Intro to College Alg class.

daabilge,"Jobs/pay: yeahhh vet pay is almost always lower. Sorry. Even the residency pay between DVM and MD pathology residencies at the same university tends to be drastically lower..

Residency success: I would look into finding a pathologist to do research with, joining the pathology club, generally getting involved in pathology. Join Davis-Thompson foundation as well! Identify programs you'd be interested in and try to set up externships during your clinical rotations. 

Benefits/raises/promotions: will depend where you end up. There's many different places you can work as a pathologist, ranging from academia to reference labs to contract research to specialty diagnostic centers to state diagnostic labs. 

In office vs work from home: again, varies, but generally pathology is a specialty that's more amenable towards work from home with the rise of digital slides and whole slide imaging systems. If you end up somewhere that doesn't have a slide scanner or where you have a necropsy caseload you might be working in-office more, vs like a reference lab like Idexx might have you mostly work from home.|Yeah I send a written summary of what's going on with the owner and then email the full record to the ER. I'll also call the ER to give them a heads up, and if they provide me with an estimate, I give that to the client. I don't guesstimate how much the ER will charge if they don't, though, that seems to make clients angrier if I underestimate.

If it's one of those where ER is recommended but the client is unwilling but MIGHT go to ER I usually try to include a bit of extra info and basically that case summary and relevant diagnostic results in their discharge notes in case they do decide to go to ER.|I've absolutely taken off claws when they're problematic - I had a polydactyl/syndactyl where the syndactyl claw was thick and platelike and growing out sideways like a hammerhead into the sides of the toes next to it.

Cat kept the remaining claws, but that one (or technically two that had become one?) needed to go and the cat has a better quality of life for it.|I guess to elaborate on what the other commenter said, exotics would typically be where it gets ""fun"". There are standard positions for many of our domestics, and those adapt somewhat well to many of our mammalian exotics, but not always. I think Maders has guidelines for standard imaging on different types of herps, and Quesenbury has them for small mammal.

Often for small mammals, small reptiles, and birds, we do whole body rads. Typically not enough space on the animal to collimate out what you're not interested in anyway. We also may use dental radiographs to image limbs or extremities on tiny patients (I used dental rads on a tree frog to see an humeral fracture, for example) and some places use the mini-ct scanners for small patients since they've come down in price (relatively..)

The small body sizes of many of our bird and reptiles and small mammals has led to all sorts of jigs and doohickeys for imaging them. Often we do end up sedating them to obtain images, but also there's positioning aids that you can tie birds into, we also sometimes ""invent"" things like a little rig I built for imaging turtles that my coworker affectionately calls my panini press. I've also just taped lizards down to a rolled up towel like James Bond with the laser in Goldfinger.. 

I LOVE ultrasound for aquatics. It's so freaking easy. Water is an incredible conduction medium so you just kind of put the fish or frog or salamander in a bag of water, point the probe in its direction, and image away.

And sometimes you really have to get creative in zoo med. For big mammals they often use portable/handheld x-ray units. Columbus zoo has a video of them CT-ing a shark, which I think is Dr Junge's proudest moment. Dude loves his CT.|I don't think there's like a discrete subspecialty where you'd train in exclusively large animal oncology, but in a region with a lot of large animal cases you might be able to carve out a niche at a big referral center, like maybe Rood and Riddle would hire a surg onc doctor with a strong equine background, or you could try to go the academic route and work for a university hospital. We had an oncologist at my vet school who would consult on equine cases because her research was on melanomas.|I'm a member of a couple professional societies for topics of interest (Reptile and Amphibian medicine, aquatics, and pathology) and I get their journals and CE events. I also am part of two journal clubs, so we scour recent publications for topics of interest and meet up to chat about them. I also teach prevet at a university so I make my students read papers as well.|I believe penetrating captive bolt is generally preferred for this sort of use. I'm not a large animal vet but it's what I've used for large fish.|Yeah our wildlife officers just use a rifle... safer at a distance|I would message her directly first. I would use specific examples and provide the appropriate information in response to those examples. 

If you feel that the information she's putting out is harmful and outside the scope of her practice, you might also consider reaching out to her states veterinary medical association and/or licensing board since that may technically fall under practicing without a license. Unfortunately, we don't have great title protection for our techs and it's not necessarily illegal to just give bad pet advice, although if she's misrepresenting herself as a medical professional in order to do so, that may cross that line.|For wellness, my common questions tend to be along the lines of
- dental prevention/cleaning/does my grade 4 perio actually need a dental cleaning or can I just let them all rot out of his skull
- (when) should I spay/neuter?
- why do we need the vaccines/what are we preventing?
- the food allergy talk, alongside the general allergy talk, because everyone and their mother will tell you their dog is allergic to chicken and corn
- should I be feeding a raw/grain free/whatever the current trendy diet is? What's the best diet?
- obesity/yes your pet is obese/no, your cat should not be spherical
- what's the deal with (disease/pet thing currently in the news)
- why should we run the screening bloodwork/fecal
- general medication compliance (his cough seemed better so I stoped the pimobendan)

And then a handful of common case presentations that I'd be ready to approach and have some differentials for, by species

Dog
- rash/ear infection/other dermy things
- lameness
- cough
- diarrhea
- change in appetite
- inappropriate urination
- vomiting

Cat
- hiding more
- losing weight
- inappropriate urination
- change in appetite
- chronic vomiting
- upper respiratory stuff

**and if you'll be doing exotics**

Small fermenting fuzzies (rabbits, guinea pigs)
- URI
- eye discharge
- Decreased appetite/defecation (most experienced owners will also just tell you stasis, so your job is to fix it and ID the underlying cause)
- drooling/dropping feed/other dental spur things

Other rodents (rats especially)
- chronic RI (and it's almost always mycoplasma, and they almost always infect their whole colony, so good time to have that biosecurity/quarantine talk)
- fur mites
- masses

Ferrets
- Rubber foreign body (young ones)
- adrenal disease (and in young ones, questions about adrenal disease)
- weird diarrheas
- lethargy/seizure/insulinoma
- respiratory

Reptiles
- hasn't eaten in 6 months, now lethargic
- RI
- mouth rot
- Generally poor husbandry (what I mean is, bone up on husbandry and supportive care approaches)

Fish
- Water Quality
- WATER QUALITY
- **WATER QUALITY**|Repetition is key - you'll get these drilled into you after having them as cases so I would start out somewhere that offers you time to think about your cases when you're starting out. My first practice unfortunately started me on 20 minute appointments, if I could do it all over again I'd definitely want at least 40. Getting those reps in will help you build confidence in each topic and plan out a speel.. and it's always fine to say ""hey I don't know, I'll find out"" and go read some journals and find your answer.. like for the weird dog respiratory disease, I had a bunch of clients that I sent an email to once I had a chance to read up from trusted sources. I read a lot of journals anyway, largely because I'm trying to get out of GP and into a pathology residency or a research lab and so for every residency I applied to, I read up their universities recent major publications, and likewise for each lab I applied to, I read their entire bibliography.

I tend to be more of a ""lumper"" which helps since your initial diagnostic approach for each differential under each case ""archetype"" is going to be pretty similar.. and most of those are common enough that you'll have plenty of repetition. I also use Blackwell's 5 minute consult and I use Veterinary Partner for handouts on specific diseases. You can do CE for areas you feel weak. Conferences tend to also focus on common diseases more often. 

For the exotics stuff, a mix of externships, firsthand experience, and CE. Lefeber is a good place to start, Miami also hosts a monthly free CE for mostly exotics hematology and clinical pathology topics, and then respective professional societies (WAVMA and ARAV) and their journals and CE. I did a couple lab animal conferences (POLA and CLASS) that helped with rodents, rabbits, and fish. I took a master herpetologist course that helped a lot with husbandry for the reptiles and amphibians.|For pathology, depends highly on what you end up doing. Salaries for academia aren't great. Salaries for industry/reference labs tend to be fairly good. Salaries for contract research organizations or private labs tend to be excellent.

A bunch of my pathology professors from vet school would read slides for reference labs on the side since many labs now use digital slides and have a lot of flexibility/operate kind of like digital radiology.|And the benefits.. The one I interned at had a gym and water park and full catered dining hall (all included in employee benefits) on site, plus great insurance and some of the best techs I've ever worked with. I'd very much like to go back after I'm boarded.|Depends on what type of vet you want to be.. and what you consider travel.

As a GP it may be difficult, especially in a smaller practice. At my first job out of school, I got one and a half days off per week and 2 weeks total vacation per year and had to work out coverage for any vacations (or conferences) with my coworkers, and I would get last pick of vacation dates and conferences because I was the most junior. It may also cut into your travel.. like I had that office call me at my friends wedding to ask about an exotics case because none of the other vets felt comfortable answering, which was rather frustrating.. A classmate of mine is at a larger clinic (corporate, like 10ish doctors) so she has a lot more freedom with time off and travel. 

Meanwhile some specialties have travel cooked into your job - like USDA or other public health/regulatory positions. And, of course, if you're a leader in your specialty you'll get invited to speak at conferences, and between the conference and your employer, someone will often cover some part of your travel expenses (like hotel room or the conference admission). May not be locations you always want to visit - although I'm finally getting to see the national zoo as part of an upcoming conference - but it's still travel even if a good chunk of it will be spent learning/working.

You also have to consider travel expenses with your student debt.|The internship requirement is becoming absurd. Even in pathology - which doesn't require an internship - a lot of programs are giving preference to students who have completed an internship, and there's a growing number of pathology specific internships where your duties look suspiciously similar to a resident, but you don't qualify for boards and the pay is somehow even lower.. and they're one year appointments so you have that additional financial barrier of needing to move for just one year of work. They state it's because you'll have additional clinical insight from your internship, but working as a clinician rather than an intern apparently doesn't count for that because you couldn't understand the academic rigor. Working as a clinician full-time while getting a masters apparently doesn't count either. 

And I've noticed - for at least two programs that I'm aware of - the residency director has openly slept with students or residents and still holds that position. 

Although I think the most egregious example I know of was when (and details are left vague to protect identities) a resident discovered that their significant other at another institution had attempted suicide and was punished for taking PTO to go visit their SO in the hospital.|Jobs/pay: yeahhh vet pay is almost always lower. Sorry. Even the residency pay between DVM and MD pathology residencies at the same university tends to be drastically lower..

Residency success: I would look into finding a pathologist to do research with, joining the pathology club, generally getting involved in pathology. Join Davis-Thompson foundation as well! Identify programs you'd be interested in and try to set up externships during your clinical rotations. 

Benefits/raises/promotions: will depend where you end up. There's many different places you can work as a pathologist, ranging from academia to reference labs to contract research to specialty diagnostic centers to state diagnostic labs. 

In office vs work from home: again, varies, but generally pathology is a specialty that's more amenable towards work from home with the rise of digital slides and whole slide imaging systems. If you end up somewhere that doesn't have a slide scanner or where you have a necropsy caseload you might be working in-office more, vs like a reference lab like Idexx might have you mostly work from home.|Yeah I send a written summary of what's going on with the owner and then email the full record to the ER. I'll also call the ER to give them a heads up, and if they provide me with an estimate, I give that to the client. I don't guesstimate how much the ER will charge if they don't, though, that seems to make clients angrier if I underestimate.

If it's one of those where ER is recommended but the client is unwilling but MIGHT go to ER I usually try to include a bit of extra info and basically that case summary and relevant diagnostic results in their discharge notes in case they do decide to go to ER.|I've absolutely taken off claws when they're problematic - I had a polydactyl/syndactyl where the syndactyl claw was thick and platelike and growing out sideways like a hammerhead into the sides of the toes next to it. I don't phrase it as declawing - I also don't do declaws unless medically indicated - so I called it what it is, which is a digit amputation. Cat kept the remaining claws, but that one (or technically two that had become one?) needed to go and the cat has a better quality of life for it.|I guess to elaborate on what the other commenter said, exotics would typically be where it gets ""fun"". There are standard positions for many of our domestics, and those adapt somewhat well to many of our mammalian exotics, but not always. I think Maders has guidelines for standard imaging on different types of herps, and Quesenbury has them for small mammal.

Often for small mammals, small reptiles, and birds, we do whole body rads. Typically not enough space on the animal to collimate out what you're not interested in anyway. We also may use dental radiographs to image limbs or extremities on tiny patients (I used dental rads on a tree frog to see an humeral fracture, for example) and some places use the mini-ct scanners for small patients since they've come down in price (relatively..)

The small body sizes of many of our bird and reptiles and small mammals has led to all sorts of jigs and doohickeys for imaging them. Often we do end up sedating them to obtain images, but also there's positioning aids that you can tie birds into, we also sometimes ""invent"" things like a little rig I built for imaging turtles that my coworker affectionately calls my panini press. I've also just taped lizards down to a rolled up towel like James Bond with the laser in Goldfinger.. 

I LOVE ultrasound for aquatics. It's so freaking easy. Water is an incredible conduction medium so you just kind of put the fish or frog or salamander in a bag of water, point the probe in its direction, and image away.

Dude loves his CT.|Male, relatively recent grad, suburban major Midwestern city, 115k with no production (started at 96k) and I rotate between multiple clinics owned by the same entity with GP, Urgent Care, small mammal exotics, reptile, amphibian, and aquatics. 14 days PTO, $1,200 CE. I also have teaching duties with a local university and do research, altogether make about 150k across my jobs

Eta: I work nine 4-hour shifts (technically they're 5h with 1h per shift for phones/lunch, usually it's four 8-6 days and one half day) per week at the clinics and then teaching/research duties on my half days and weekends|The passing grade varies from year to year - typically it's around 425-450 which comes out to around 55-60%

Passing grade is based on what's called the Modified Angloff Method for deriving a pass-fail score, so they basically have a group of experts decide what would constitute a passing grade for a minimally competent candidate and then subject it to a whole bunch of discussion to establish a concrete cutoff score based on their expected difficulty.|Congrats!

It's a really straightforward interview with fairly classic vet school interview questions. Prepare for the usual sorts of interview questions (there's some really good examples online) and don't panic. They're just trying to find out if you're a good fit for them, and you should also see if they're a good fit for you. Nobody is out to trick you or intentionally ask anything confusing or difficult.

Be yourself, rest up the night before, dress nice and find a space with minimal distractions. Don't be surprised if your interviewers are a bit stoic - they're not supposed to lead you or react in a way that would change your responses. Keep in mind that it is closed file, so your interviewers know absolutely nothing about you going in.

We're all just regular folks just like you, so don't be intimidated. We've all been in your place and know how scary it can be. This is actually my favorite time of year because I get to meet all the new prospective students and hear all about your path to vet med and your goals and dreams.|Nobody I know has left the profession entirely, but I had one classmate who left clinical practice to do a home euthanasia service after being harassed and stalked by a client and getting no support from their employer. Another is now a rep for a pharmaceutical company after trying two private practices. Once my contract is up in May, I'll be quitting my current jobs in private practice and teaching and taking a job exclusively in research.|You could do aquatic medicine. I'd see if your school has a student chapter of WAVMA. They also offer a pretty good student discount on individual membership and on their conferences. If youre also into amphibians consider ARAV as well.|I mean yeah I'd agree the main focus is dog medicine - even cats are often taught as a variant to dogs, although we had a whole semester of equine/ruminant anatomy - but from what I've seen a lot of vet schools are pretty ""customizable"" although usually that means you have to set that opportunity up yourself. We had tracks for large animals, small animal, mixed, and equine and then you could also ""build your own""

I was lucky enough to go to a school that had a pretty solid aquatics foundation, we had a class taught by a CertAqV and an active WAVMA chapter that did a lot of wetlabs so I got a good chunk of my credit for the CertAqV done while in school. My school didn't do any live exotics on clinics so I had to do all external rotations and set them up myself. I had classmates doing aquatics who did summer internships with zoos or aquariums or with aquaculture producers. I'm more into toxicologic pathology so I did lab animal stuff with our zebrafish colonies.|Ohio State - certainly still not perfect but they did at least have electives in exotics (which have gotten better since it's now Dr. Nick Jew from Medvet teaching the reptile/amphibian classes and Dr. Oglesbee teaching rabbits and avian medicine) and aquatics (last I heard, it was Dr. Flint and Dr. Malbrue teaching, we also had Dr. Coble and I think he's still in the area so he might still guest lecture)

They went through a curriculum redesign but last I heard, they still had a good selection of electives and then our clinical year was very customizable. Still not perfect - they have many of the systemic issues with vet school like treating the students as free labor to supplement their hiring shortages, and they don't see exotics in their hospital except for the necropsy floor and through lab animal - but I thought they did a fair job.|Apoquel did not have a [significantly different incidence of cancers](https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/257/5/javma.257.5.507.xml) compared to other allergy therapies (corticosteroids and cyclosporine) which makes sense because it's fairly selective for JAK1. The caution for use in pets with a history of certain cancers also isn't really based on anything from the tox data for apoquel specifically, it comes from data on less selective JAK inhibitors (such as Jakafi and Xeljanz) used on the human side. Theoretically blocking JAK1 (and therefore IL2 and IL4) carries some risk of inhibiting NK Cell activation which should still be considered in patients with a history of certain types of cancer.|Join ARAV if you haven't already! There's a student Facebook page; we have some fun plans to get it more interactive this year|Tbh it's kind of a matter of picking your battles. Ideally we'd do it perfect every time, but that's not really practical (especially on a senior pug!) so in that case it depends on the test you're running and what you're after. 

Like most if not all tests run off a blue top NEED to be perfectly full and NEED to be a clean stick because they tend to be for coags. I don't really care so much if it's going into a serum separator, since it'll clot anyway, as long as we're not hemolyzing the sample a ton. Purple is kind of an in-between with a frustrating amount of ""it depends"" - if it's just for a 4DX I wouldn't be too concerned, if it's for wellness I care a bit more but not the end of the world, if I'm suspicious or monitoring like a low platelet number, I'd absolutely want it to be a clean stick and a full tube on just that stick.. and if you have to poke twice and can get enough for a full purple the second poke, I'd rather have that purple all be from the same stick, but I'd also rather have one full purple with the right anticoagulant to blood ratio vs two partially-full purples with the wrong ratio if that's what it comes to. 

Also adding through a vaccutainer can be problematic because that vacuum is calibrated to the ideal draw volume for the tube and if you lose the vacuum, you're then guesstimating the right ratio, although depending on what/why you're testing that can be more or less problematic. Pushing into the vaccutainer through the needle can also lead to hemolysis, so if I have to add to a purple, I usually take the cap off and remove my needle.|I'd second trying to shadow a local practice, but you'd likely have to be over 18 for them to allow it.

In the meantime try and get some general horse experience if you haven't already. If you're already involved in the equestrian world a bit, it'll be easier to get into equine medicine. I worked with a therapeutic riding stable to learn basic horseman terms, safe handling, and basic equine husbandry stuff.|I do mixed exotics.

I prefer to autoligate where possible (cats, small dogs) but still do a three clamp technique and strangle knot for the uterine body. I do modified three clamp for larger dogs with one circumferential in the crush and one transfixing. I typically use hemoclips for rabbits. Small rodents are often just cautery. 

I do scrotal neuters for cats, prescrotal for dogs, varies for other species. 

I tend to close any incision with intradermals, since it keeps the animal from messing with the incision as much. I do a local block for the same reason. A lot of exotics don't tend to do well with a cone, and I don't always trust owners to use a cone anyway, so the more I can take matters into my own hands, the better.|Like the other comment said, salary, expected work hours, staffing ratio. Clear and straightforward. 

I also like to see certain amenities (I like having an ultrasound and endoscopy and in-house labs. I mainly use endoscopy for exotics, though). I want to be able to practice the way I feel comfortable and have the tools to be successful. 

I do NOT want to see non-competes or other restrictive components to the contract. I don't really care about production if the base salary is good, but I don't want to see negative accrual. I also don't really care about equity. 

And I'll absolutely ask during an interview how long your staff has been there, about your turnover rate, about the number of RVTs vs assistants.. I'm looking for a place that can retain their staff, and has enough well-trained staff that I can focus on being a doctor.|Oh absolutely. I was a vet assistant in high school, it was a really steep learning curve but after a couple months I got used to handling and everything. Tbh, for the syringe thing, just ask if you can take home a syringe without a needle and practice pulling it back and handling safely. Don't be afraid to ask - safety first!

I ended up leaving vet med for a while to pursue archaeology and then ended up in medical research and then eventually a small zoo.. and didn't come back to small animal until I got a job as a vet assistant in vet school. It was a steep learning curve all over again, I was like ""what the heck is a cytopoint"" (when I'd left small animal practice, apoquel had just come on the market) and cat handling and care had come along SO far (and tbh the field is all the better for it!)|Depends on your state practice act. I would also make sure to get full informed consent from the owner. 

I was allowed to assist with TNR during my first year of vet school under supervision from a vet, and my school did a summer externship program for first years where they could do small animal practice after their first year under supervision, including surgery duties.

And I would get the SAVMA student liability insurance if you're doing it.|I really enjoyed comparative physiology and pathology. It's really cool to see the different ""answers"" that life came up with for different problems. On the pathology side of things, sort of same idea but it's also neat to see the different ways things can go wrong, but also the unexpected similarities across different species. 

I also really enjoy teaching and client education is a huge part of the job. My big clients as a clinician were all massive nerds.. and then my new position will have me teaching vet students and tech students. I also have a tik tok where I host journal clubs that gets like maybe 50 followers and tens of likes, but every so often someone will comment like ""oh my gosh this is so cool!"" And that makes it worthwhile...|I mean if the owner declined diagnostics for the infectious disease case that's not your mistake, that's on them. In most circumstances, you can't have an accurate diagnosis without running diagnostics. Just make sure your recommendation and what they declined is in the record.

And as far as the spay goes, sometimes spays do be bleeding. I'm literally published on hemostasis in uterine surgery (from a translational research perspective for hysterotomy but still) and I still get bloody spays. 

End of the day, you do your best with what you've got.|Some residency programs require an internship, so it'll vary by the program/type of residency you're applying to. An internship does make you more competitive regardless. You can still do an internship after time in GP (that's what I'm doing for pathology, which doesn't require an internship anyway but it's become so competitive that it may as well)|Also check the individual governing organizations page (you can find open spots outside the match) and reach out to residency coordinators early, individually. Pathology doesn't use VIRMP at all and when I worked for Michigan medicine in lab animal medicine (ULAM) they had their individual deadline a fair bit earlier than the VIRMP deadline and would make offers early if they had a good candidates|If you like inverts, Lewbart is the go-to.

With it being 0.01c per review, spending a few bucks might be good for extra work money. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyamfhp/ | It is a possibility, though unlikely. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyamayw/ | I'm not professional, and you should not base the entirety of Mysterium off of me. It appears you also only responded to a singular part of my comment.

Higher ratings would inflate the presence when searching ""VPN"", but ordinary people would check the reviews. If you look at reviews on play store, the trending reviews are currently 1 star and 5 star, which could intrigue people to look further. Seeing all the spam reviews would definitely make people suspicious, which is why Mysterium wouldn't do this, unless they are absolutely stupid. Looking through the ""see all reviews"" though, I scrolled a bit and didn't see a single ""Thank"" review. If you read the rest of my comment, it would also show similar to this, so I am hoping you actually read this comment this time. If Mysterium wanted review bots, I think they would be smart enough to not spam just ""Thank"", but rather random sets, which would be very suspicious still, but still show intelligence. Unless Mysterium is using reverse psychology here, they likely aren't trying to buy reviews. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyflai5/ | i was using the myst app, not hosting a node (if you're saying that)

Sobleulf,"In Ohio, cats, dogs, and ferrets must legally be vaccinated and the vaccine must be given by a vet and a certificate must accompany the vaccine.

BUT, horses, goats, cows, rabbits, and pigs can also get rabies. If you live in an area where your livestock or other pets could come in contact with skunks, raccoons, coyotes, feral dogs, feral cats, or bats, of course they may consider getting some vaccines from the feed store.|Yes, sorry. Only about half of Ohio’s 88 counties have mandatory rabies vaccination. I live in a county that requires it, our county regularly has to drop oral rabies vaccine baits to vaccinate wildlife like raccoons. 

Also, any cat or dog visiting a State Park or campsite under the Division of Parks and Recreation or Division of Forestry, regardless of the county, must have proof of vaccination for rabies upon request.",Veterinarian
FrannyZoey8,"This is a rotten situation for you to have to endure. It’s hard enough to do the vet work all day without the worries of the support staff not doing their basic job.

Is it on you? Yes, in the sense that if a board or insurance complaint ever happens…..you are the one responsible for documentation of the case. I don’t think it’s on you, however, to have to enforce what the owner should. Medical records are legal documents; I weigh the owner took it more seriously.

You mentioned there’s an office manager-you’re doing the right thing by communicating with her; maybe the legwork she will have to do, along with your dissatisfaction with the current system, will get the owner’s attention.

What kind of system are you using? I’m assuming it’s paperless-can’t they just enter them then and there? 

Could you alter you schedule so that you have the last hour (never works!🤣), the first hour, or lunch, to catch up on paperwork? Could you have a more serious sit-down with powers that be? Explain why this inattentive behavior is not profitable? Not conducive to an efficient workplace with good communication? Maybe you haven’t made it clear enough? You shouldn’t really have to-it’s an untenable situation.|Thank you for suggesting positivity!|I’m also an owner, and have a similar outlook. Our assistants start at $18-the head tech is at $27. I heavily discount care as well, and like you, try to be really flexible. We started giving a $300 month healthcare stipend; they can use it as they please. One great idea my friend has who owns a specialty hospital is to pay for pet insurance for each employee. I’m going to look into that! Who in God’s name is paying techs $10/hour?//|I was in your shoes about two years ago! I’ve been in practice for 20 years, own a hospital, and finally have enough staff to consider what I actually want. I looked hard into a non-traditional residency. I wrote letters, actually found mentors, the whole nine yards.

The further I got in the process, the more uncomfortable it felt. The program was going to take 4-5 years; like you, I‘m not near a university, so the entire time away was like 28 non-consecutive weeks. Not terrible, but something to be considered.

i began to wonder if that amount of academia was what I really wanted. I think I finally realized I wanted something more in my life-  but board certification wasn’t it. I actually became a firefighter and EMT-it’s been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.   


Maybe a residency at a specialty practice would be far more tolerable to someone who’s been in the real world for a while.   


Yes, it's possible, and I’m sure you can do it. No, it’s not crazy. I think if you can practice for at least ten years a a boarded radiologist, then the time investment pencils. Best of luck to you!|Working from home does sound like heaven 🤣|I have to respectfully disagree. I’ve mentored a lot of young vets, and never felt the need for a power dynamic. I thinks it’s part of the profession that we mentor new graduates. They need it, and they need someone who’s present In the same facility.|&#x200B;

I misspoke by using the word “need,” I agree. But again, I’m not sure why you think a power dynamic is such an inevitable conclusion to a mentorship. For twenty years, my hospital has had interns, new grads, relatively new grads and support staff who all needed mentorship or collaborative advice.I think perhaps we have a different view of mentorship. To me, it’s a vet on site who helps you m make medical and surgical decisions in real time. Mentorship can also help with the pressures and daily ups and downs of the profession. Having a mentor nearby the first time something detrimental happens with a patient is a very, very valuable thing. 

If I had a new grad who had an off site mentor and kept calling them on the phone all day, I would certainly feel like the employee’s attention was divided. It would be an absurd system.   


Most veterinary schools have ample resources for help with contract negotiation. To your other point, an “ethical situation that they’re not ready for their boss to know about:” yikes. When do they discuss it with their boss? After they’ve covered it up? Spoken to resources outside the hospital and broken confidentiality?   


Again, we have quite different ideas about mentorship. I’m curious ; where are you in your career?   


Also, could you expound on the nature of the “power dynamic?”|I’m not an attorney, but I suspect the charge isn’t as important as the sentence; if you’re convicted of a felony, it may be difficult to get a DEA, and many employers draw the line at that conviction. A good lawyer will be your best bet here.|Yes, and yes, lol. I managed to get bitten in the face by a Cocker Spaniel on my FIRST DAY as an assistant. The bite was minor-the embarrassment major. Everything takes time. Go easy on yourself-if you’re constantly discouraged, that will sabotage  your ability. No one, repeat, no one, is an expert out of the gate. I’ve been a veterinarian for over 20 years now- gets lots, lots better. It may help to find a good mentor.|I did that.",Other

I’m currently an intern at an AZA zoo in their veterinary department and will end up with around 600 hours after I finish in a few months. I have 330 hours from being an intern at a marine mammal rehab center, 550 hours from being a fellow at a wildlife rehabilitation center, 800 hours from a small cat/dog clinic as a veterinary assistant/receptionist, so about 2200 veterinary hours. I also worked at a small non-profit farm and have about 300 hours, 700 hours working as a kennel attendant, so about 1000 non-veterinary animal hours. In addition, I have about 400 hours working in the food industry, 200 animal care volunteer hours from 2 different aquariums and a wildlife center, and 400 hours working as a laboratory assistant (basically almost like a TA) at my school and helped prepare for all the biological science courses. I will probably have atleast 400 more animal hours by the time I apply, after I finish up with my current internship and get a job somewhere else.

kindaBigBetch,"Experience and learning from your colleagues/classmates will  help! No one is able to know 100% and your learning doesn't stop once you graduate. If you don't know or fully understand something right this moment, you still have the potential to learn it later on (this isn't a race to the graduation line). I'm sure you've heard plenty of not comparing yourself to others, but for real, focus on how you can feel confident with what you know. Your program should lay enough groundwork for you but if there's areas you think your knowledge is lacking, take those thoughts and channel it into ways to bridge your perceived knowledge gaps rather than disparage yourself.

Reviewing earlier semesters could be a good starting point to see where your basic knowledge could use some brushing up. Online resources like Merck's Manual, Clinician's Brief, DVM360 (that also has a YouTube channel), VIN/Veterinary Partner, eclinpath.com are fairly accessible and can help you explore things more thoroughly. Even consider webinars or if you can attend a conference with lectures on areas you want to know more about. 

It can become a vicious cycle of constantly measuring yourself with others and I think coming to terms with the fact there will be always be others who know more and less than you can be difficult; especially in an academically competitive, professional programs. Try and frame this more about wanting to improve for yourself rather than feeling like you need to 'catch up' to others and I think you'll have a healthier approach to learning and practicing as a future doctor.

Hadopi went through so many changes, and was such a wonky system that even if I 'technically' had a fair amount of reasons to receive notices from them (and did), I never receive 2 in a short enough period that the first was still valid and counting in the X/3 counter.

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

Running a D-VPN node, decentralized VPN node, for this exact reason, why should we, and how could we then rely on a 'centralized' committee/deciding entity to validate what is Ok or not to run through our connections, and how could ""validation"" ever **prevent** 'validated parties' to miss-behave, and how said centralized validation body would ever care to or be able to plea for the node runner's innocence against the infractions committed by their validated partners.|Okay, great, multiple people, but still the case of one single country and jurisdiction, and still solely copyright issues.

And yes I know there is whitelisting, which basically excludes non-mysterium approved traffic, which basically excludes private users and randos all together, which basically defeats the reason I'm running a node at all, which is to give wider and less censored internet access to people, individuals, not just entities and organizations.|Same, I think I had around 30 sessions from Benin, and my previous biggest client (\~24h/450GB) was from a Japanese IP.|It seems they like to ping for uptime/latency, or that Netherland has a bigger community of dVPN clients.|for just 2 weeks of running this node, if it keeps going at this rate every week a big client like that, I will fucking offset the powerdraw of my whole rack just with mysterium.|French residential IP, I don't mind answering, I have enough old comments in french speaking of stuff happening in France that I'm already country-doxed.|https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3|THIS, is the reason I run a node.

As nothing but a tinkerer, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) is a post I made a while back when I started running a node, and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/comment/hw2bwil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of the 'extra steps' I took and considered.

I would advocate Mysterium nodes (or any front-facing thing period) to never be ran natively, which I why I went ahead from the start with the ""unsupported"" configuration of running it on a sudoer user in its own dedicated unprivileged LXC container, and doing some fairly extended firewalling from the host (proxmox).

To be honest I would prefer Mysterium nodes to be distributed in this kind of form, as a turnkey LXC package for example.

I admit I just had not noticed u/peter-sovietsquirrel was part of the team, I was just focused on answering every incoming observation and opinion the best I could.

I understand about your position, sadly I doubt it would suffice in France to be out of troubles.

If it can indeed let the node-runner deny responsibility of the activity he was taken to court for, it could still lead to fines and sanctions as running a somewhat critical service without proper -*and mandatory by law\*\*(see refs)*\- traceability, allowing bad actors to stay out of reach.

In the example in Germany, the guy was contacted by Right holders for copyright issues.

In France, you're directly facing Hadopi (now the [Arcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Authority_for_Audiovisual_and_Digital_Communication)). Their ""notices"" are warnings you can't rebut fully without going to court, and at the third in a given time period, your uplink is shut down and cops knock at your door.

Unless you're running a website with a mail address to be contacted on concerning copyright on the same IP, there is no ""amicable step"" of just talking the Right holders out beforehand.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind though I was **NOT** raising really concerns about relatively mundane stuff like torrenting or using an other country's netflix geo-locked catalogue (even if you can still end up with sanctions like fines);

But **WAY MORE** sensitive crimes, like cyber attacks or 'child media', for which French authorities, like the [ANSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_nationale_de_la_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_des_syst%C3%A8mes_d%27information), would descend hard on you for being the roadblock in their investigation that made the actual criminals unreachable, and possibly charge you same as an accomplice.

&#x200B;

Concerning your no-log policy you want to abide by, **I hear you and won't push it further**, though I see it a bit as a marketing buzz-word in the VPN world which is only a matter of context.

I like transparency and control, hence why I'm much into the vision of web3.0, /hence why I would have wished node runners to have options to define AND transparently disclose their own policies about logging for every dVPN-client to see in their client interface.

All I can do now is hope that you or maybe an other network will consider it and implement it properly.

I'll still be hanging out in the community, and participating by running my node though with very custom filtering rules inside and outside the LXC container to avoid abuse.

**I take the pledge** to not stir up the topic of logging outside of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/) as to not disturb the community by starting useless debates, though I would be happy to discuss it again if the question is raised officially one day.

(as such, I also added an edit to the thread.)

With the webui as an exception to one device on the network and necessary communications with the gateway to establish connection, there is drops and rejects on every ports to every IP ranges I use on my subnets.

Note I have no fucking idea how to do that with WSL in windows, I haven't touched that. I'm running this on proxmox.

I did that not with stability in mind, more about security. Stability wise though, I haven't seen it reboot (nor looked if it did tbh), I just left the container run for 28days.

""Verified partner traffic"" is basically sadly corporatish talk to say that they vouche for this traffic, but I anything goes still wrong... are we supposed to entrust the elusive unnamed validity checker entity will come over to the court room and plead for our case?

I wouldn't bet my legal defense on operators of a dVPN network, for the exact same reason I wanted to be part of this network: independence, ownership of ones own data, privacy.

I would choose way over that being able to vouche for my own traffic and have the means to defend myself in case of legal troubles, because, and that's a big one:

\> what's worth a decentralized VPN if node runners would have to rely on a centralized authority to back their legal safety? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxt3p23/ | Two things:

* That's one person in one country. Just saying ""twas not me, I run node"" without logs in hand is worth nothing to French authorities for example. The ""there was one guy who"" isn't really pertinent.
* Torrenting is kind of the least serious thing you could be concerned about legally. I think I already gave a few examples above that would prompt authorities of anywhere to not give a fuck about your argument of ""twas not me, I run node"" if you don't have means to prove it was someone else's doing. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxtyyk2/ | \> NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed.

Yeah no, I confirm that to be protected, under french law, you have to have the above-mentioned details in your logs, or it's worth nothing as proof, just 'good enough' to assume you MAY be innocent, and it's up to whether or not the judge likes your face and had their coffee in the morning.

&#x200B;

\>The government is pretty strict about these things and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions

Yup, even though they are ""kinda"" slow. Hadopi went through so many changes, and was such a wonky system that even if I 'technically' had a fair amount of reasons to receive notices from them (and did), I never receive 2 in a short enough period that the first was still valid and counting in the X/3 counter.

&#x200B;

\>I also can not assume that the Mysterium whitelisted traffic is benign.

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

Running a D-VPN node, decentralized VPN node, for this exact reason, why should we, and how could we then rely on a 'centralized' committee/deciding entity to validate what is Ok or not to run through our connections, and how could ""validation"" ever **prevent** 'validated parties' to miss-behave, and how said centralized validation body would ever care to or be able to plea for the node runner's innocence against the infractions committed by their validated partners. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hyj3w5y/ | Okay, great, multiple people, but still the case of one single country and jurisdiction, and still solely copyright issues.

And yes I know there is whitelisting, which basically excludes non-mysterium approved traffic, which basically excludes private users and randos all together, which basically defeats the reason I'm running a node at all, which is to give wider and less censored internet access to people, individuals, not just entities and organizations. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxx2htr/ | Well, Chromebook means most likely you're still running ChromeOS... aka Gentoo Linux... which isn't really like 'standard' debian based linux for example.

Running a native node to which randos will connect to isn't really the best thing either if anything goes wrong.

I would say, for sake of simplicity, your best shot would be to first run an unprivileged LXC container, and install a small debian based image in it, make sure it can connect to the internet, AND gets its own IP on the local network (for sake of easy port-forwarding).

It would let you have a proper install that doesn't affect your host's configuration, and that you have absolute control over if needed.

Then follow the standard Linux CLI install.

When it comes to resources, my own full OS LXC container on proxmox, with the node running, and while the session is active, doesn't use more than 2.5gigs of storage space, and half of its assigned 128mb of ram. A bit storage heavy, but overall light to run.

If you wanna add a layer of security, possibly go into IPtables on your chromeOS/gentoo host and isolate it from the IPrange of your network, minus node's webui (port 4449), and minus gateway communications, but still blocking sensitive stuff like the gateway's webui and ports like 22/445/512.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Important note: If you already have a node running, having a second node on the same IP doesn't make any positive change, might even penalize you. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxjjgmg/ | Thought little more tip:

You should give 3gigs of storage space total to the LXC container.

Using a lean debian 11 image, the node install script would fail with a 2gig virtual drive, because while unpacking you go over that amount.

&#x200B;

If you encounter issues, or want more details about how I went about with my setup, you can find a long read about it on a previous post of mine where I encountered some miss-configurations during installation (and some weird behavior that really wasn't how things should go), how I did some firewall configuration ect [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/), or see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/comment/hw8j91c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when with someone I went about firewall configuration for a docker install (which I haven't done myself, but wanted to know how I would go about doing it).

Keep in mind though, I'm not an expert, my word is as good as anyone else's, don't be afraid to do some of your own complementary research! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxky47g/ | Same, I think I had around 30 sessions from Benin, and my previous biggest client (\~24h/450GB) was from a Japanese IP. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxahqi5/ | It seems they like to ping for uptime/latency, or that Netherland has a bigger community of dVPN clients. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxaho3y/ | for just 2 weeks of running this node, if it keeps going at this rate every week a big client like that, I will fucking offset the powerdraw of my whole rack just with mysterium. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hx9htfa/ | French residential IP, I don't mind answering, I have enough old comments in french speaking of stuff happening in France that I'm already country-doxed. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxaexc4/ | https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxd6my2/ | Hey hi, I followed your issue on their repo. Their actually-intended default configuration looks to be fine. Not the best, but clearly mindful.

I would guess what caused this behavior on my setup is somehow wireguard or myst didn't configured itself properly, or had issues interacting, fluke knows why, in my LXC container, even though the only modifications done to have the mysterium install script work was to spoof it to generic linux headers, fill in missing packets and add some gpg repo keys manually.

Something, between this or a quirk in the default debian11--container-image provided by proxmox might have borked something.

I solved the issue on my end, but I'll keep the firewall good-behavior cage around the container just for peace of mind and added layer of security.

So it might be specific to this kind of installation, but **if it can bork like** ***that*** **and this easily**, adding a way to review and modify the wireguard and firewall config (what parameters are to be applied to ephemeral wireguard interfaces) directly from the webui would allow plug&play-expecting beginners/neophytes to be warned about, troubleshoot and fix such issues, especially since not everyone would go from a clean install or strictly supported and tested distro/config.

Maybe a mindful feature to implement in the near future?

&#x200B;

Thank you u/Steccas for taking the time out of your day to file an issue and do the follow up on it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvon472/ | Excuuuuse me chucklenut, even that's lot of word for ""TLDR+RTFM"", jimmies rustled it seems.

I expressly follow the native linux install guide, aka the **fucking manual**. I haven't touched how Mysterium configures wireguard by default.

(and I don't want to because I want that node to be 'set&forget', I don't want to do maintenance when whatever I would have done would have it break later if the myst-devs change something)

Had to just tweak the linux headers install process and patch in the missing packets (using snapshots to launch the install, get errored out, snapshot rollback, pre-install packets, not get errored out at the same step, rinse and repeat)

I'm just here venting the fact that the default install (aka, by the book) looks to have a concerning oversight in its configuration. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveo6p9/ | *\[ -using docker can let someone achieve even host isolation \]*

Such as LXC unpriviledged container too in my case. I commend mysterium's guide to at least advise beginners to create a sudoer user instead of running the node as root, but I was more worried about beginners/neophytes who would run their node bare-metal, like on a raspPi, or on an old spare laptop/computer... possibly with a slew of vulnerabilities, or worse even, with other services running on that same box that could badly interact and/or be exploited, **plus** the fact that in this case you can't firewall it *from outside* like a container without a proper firewall box plugged to it, where user-friendly market end users are more-often-than-not using their ISP's holly router as sole 'smart' network equipment. 

*\[Also, I think that better work to prevent bad traffic FROM the node can be taken.\]*

Yes indeed, for the proxmox firewall-ing of the container, I denied it all interaction (egress and ingress) with the full IP range used by hosts on the network(minus gateway), along with sensitive gateway ports like its webui for example, or ports that would allow to gather information on the maker/software of the gateway.

Exception made of needed things such as the node's webui, still reachable by a few select hosts.

Technically, the node's container could even be rooted that who ever is in it still couldn't touch the Lan.

Imo, and that's a very personal view on it, given **the stakes of running a wide open vpn node to a residential network**, Mysterium nodes should be advised to be used **only** in containerized form (docker/lxc/lxd) since they're aiming at and talking to a mainly beginner audience.  
\+ Docker or LXD(using snap) should let it run just fine on a raspPi, and without some of the risks.  
Distributing it as a ready-to-run container would also avoid any chance of fluke-miss-configuration upon installation.

\--------------

Concerning your contribution plans, DNS filtering yes yes, would be very welcomed, and god yes monitoring. Saw in the issue thread you were thinking of graphana integration as a possibility, that would be great!

Whenever you create your repo and push something you consider satisfactory or need people to beta-test, don't hesitate to ping me if you want me to add it to an edit at the top of the post for everyone to benefit from it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvoyhzr/ | As you say, I know you're supposed to, at least for peace of mind.

But instead of just brut-blocking shit like a creature of habit keyboard facepalmer, I wanted to know what Mysterium's out-of-the-box experience was, and its behavior on an *almost typical residential network*. Observe the enemy.

Since this Dapp advertises itself as an user-friendly/**beginner-friendly** secure VPN, I took on myself to actually test its claims by following the install guide and **not** doing any extra *smart stuff* about it (aside from Proxmox-LXC image specific patching ups)

I allowed myself to see how Mysterium behaves out of the box in a controlled environment with solely already fairly hardened hosts on the network, all the hosts on that network have restrictive firewalls, SSL certificates with my own local CA, SSH keys, ect, and critical shit like IPMI interfaces or proxmox's datacenter access is segregated to an other network all together.

But the network I tested this on is managed by a residential off-the-shelf-from-my-ISP router with fairly standard config and features to the average consumer's.

And I came back to report on what I saw? To give a heads up to 'neophyte/beginner' node runners who may just have followed a tutorial to install it on a spare laptop or RaspPI they had lying around?

That maaaay be why my post is flaired as an alert, not a question. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveszrn/ | Mhm.

Basically if it was something that you know you have to do SOME config to selfhost, like a nginx+certbot reverseproxy&certification setup, it's assumed that you're gonna have to trust in the tutorial of whoever blogposter or content creator you learn from, and you know from the start that it will be a little journey and have to have security in mind.

But Mysterium presents itself as a set&forget for both node and client, and competing in the same space as centralized VPNs... not exactly the same ""targets"" obviously, the more curious-tinkerer ones, but ultimately its communication is leveled to speak to end users.

And I mean 'end-users', little to no skill/knowledge requirement announced.

And thus, the Node runner guide is roughly the same length as the DVPN user guide, in appearance thus ""as simple and straightforward"".

That's how it's 'marketed', by the Mysterium team as well as every content creator I saw talking about it.

Encouraging whoever will give them an ear to set up a node on a raspberrypi by just flashing and heading straight to the webui, no further configuration, or else to do it on a spare computer, spin up a fresh install of ubuntu or debian, install myst, jump to webui, no further configuration.

The section in which the guide actually talks about firewall and NAT is solely about troubleshooting an offline node... aka, tell you to punch holes, but not really anything about plugging up holes.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say ""Mysterium bad"", because it's indeed the node runner's responsibility to secure their network, and to not install shit on it they can't control.

But share fault, because you wouldn't advertise a sport car as a ""beginner friendly"" car to a new driver on probation license, and *omit* to tell them it's delivered with ABS toggled off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvh8m4r/ | *\[How did you block the webui? A rule using the container ip/subnet itself? What about the container localhost?\]*  
*\[Wich rules did you use? You have some suggestions?\]*  


Concerning the webui specifically, I actually limited from the outside-container firewall's ingress to the 4449 container port with as sources specific network IPs, dropping every other source.  
I will admit I took no action to protect the node's webui from dVPNclients connecting to the node (which shouldn't be needed if the node's config is applied properly), but I'm not too worried about it:

* webui's password is 50+ characters long, and not reused anywhere else, as well is the root password of the unpriviledged LXC container, and as well is the sudoer user password.
* I'm not running a decentralized VPN node for profit, but by conviction. Nothing they could do in the webui could damage my network, worse case scenario they steal my MYSTT, which I don't care about.

&#x200B;

When it comes to the other firewall's rules, I did my firewalling specific to my setup, and I re-iterate, I'm not a security expert or an expert anything, my *suggestions* I would be more curious to see how much you'll roast my firewalling more than anything!

Second, keep in mind I did all that as a container's firewall, configured from the host, which is applied to the virtual NIC from the host perspective.  
Leaving the source IP blank on firewall egress on that NIC means it catches all potential IPs the node may use.

\-**Egress** \- default Output policy : **Accept**.

Let's start: first a few destination ports this node should never have to contact, who ever is using that through a VPN is clearly trying to poke around, **Reject** on all:

* 514 in udp (remote syslog)
* 445 in tcp (active directory and samba shares, previously also netbios on old windows versions)
* 135 tcp&udp (MS RPC)
* 137-139 tcp&udp (Netbios IP legacy)
* 161-162 udp (SNMP)
* I technically should (you should) block IRC ports (6660-6669 tcp) because a lot of botnet use them, but since I run my node per conviction of help to stop speech/info censorship, I want IRC chats to be reachable through it.

Then **Reject** egress by macro HTTPS and HTTP destined to the precise IPs (CIDR32) of all my subnet's gateways, to protect their web interfaces.

Then **Reject** all egress to an IPset that represents all the static IPs of all server hosts on the on all the subnets (by CIDR32)(multiple proxmox nodes, an unraid NAS) (redundant with the rule bellow, but eh, peace of mind for a moron)

Then an IPset that take each of my subnets IP ranges (CIDR24), minus the ones of the gateways (CIDR24), and **Reject** all egress to them.

\----------------  
Then we need to talk a bit of why my network is structured like shit:  
I'm on fiber (2Gbps down, 600mbps up)  
My ISP (which is the most stable in my location, hence why I'm with them) doesn't deliver a modem and a router. The router has an onboard integrated modem.  
Not an SFP+ slot, not a coax, not anything, I legit have single mode fiber cable between a wallplate and my internet box.  
If I wanted to use my own equipment, I would be a proprietary firmware ONT SFP+ hacking journey that, even successful, could fail any day without notice whenever my ISP change something on their side.  
Also, that shitty box doesn't support ANYTHING. No link aggregation/DACP/trunk, not multiple subnets, not ip ranges superior to /24, not VLANs, and ONLY has 4 1gbps ports.  
So I just threw together a small OPNsense box that manages 4 subnets (including the IPMI management one and the one dedicated to hosts administration like the ssh and webuis of proxmox and unraid), but the 'main' subnet is directly onto the ISP router... because my OPNsense box is a very low power salvage, and would struggle too much with the kind of throughput I have.

Hence why the last egress rules are very specific to my setup and dedicated to ""patch"" issues with that shitty router/gateway I'm stuck with, and not really relevant to list here, but if you're curious, here's a nice [example](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-20377/) from one of the previous models from my ISP, hence my lack of trust.  
By default you can think about putting a **Reject** on all egress that would have gateways as destination on ports like 21 22 and 23 for example.  
Still, it's 'setup specific'! (I don't feel comfy sharing these to be honest, to not expose if I overlooked something important that could then be exploited!)  
\-------------

If I didn't had a brain-derp, it should allow the node wide access to the world wide web on most ports, minus ones that are in the non-sense category, while excluding all my subnets' hosts from being reachable, still worse case scenario allows to 'sense' my gateways but not know what maker/type they are.

&#x200B;

**Ingress** \- default Input policy: **Drop**

Then using an Alias that represent the ONLY allowed IP of the node on my network (thus excluding potential 'spawns' which would then default to drop all ingress), I defined these rules to that Alias:

**Accept** ingress on 4449 (webui) and 22 (SSH) from an IPset of specific (CIDR32) local ips

**Drop** a little list of outright all sources ingress, for peace of mind: 20,21,22,23,67,68,69,79,98,110,111,113,119, all sources. I'm almost sure I did a mistake in there, but so far people connecting to the node don't seem to have been to distraught about it, since I had clients with hour long sessions.

**Reject** on all port the IPset of all my subnets' on /24CIDRs minus the gateways (cleaner than drop for local network, that same rule is the default on all my hosts and their containers/VM, to reduce propagation risks from a compromised host to an other)

**Reject** a macro HTTPS/HTTP/LDAP ingress, because I don't want people to use it as a webhost (I'm selfhosting some stuff myself, that doesn't seem to be a good idea), denying LDAP is to avoid being used as a proxy for log4j exploits that use LDAP, but there is probably a lot more I could/should block

**Accept** on the ranges 10000:25560,25570:60000, to let clients connect to the node through the widest range of ports it uses and listens to.   
Only left a little space in the middle because I have friend's MC servers running.

That's about it, minus a few rules to no-log some stuff like the ISP router doing some multicast to 224.0.0.0/24,its-subnet/24, and pinging the shit out of everything.

To anyone reading, it's not advice, and I probably made a terrible mistake somewhere, don't copy, ask for an actual security expert, which I'm not.

&#x200B;

*\[In my case, I'm not going to run nodes in a home network/home lab environment, I'm not comfortable with that.\]*

Understandable!

*\[I'm running them hosting/vps etc.\]*

I considered it. Though often hosting/vps IPs are blocked by a lot of services (including streaming plateforms), but also are very susceptible to being blocked and/or monitored by countries/organizations which intend to censor and do speech/opposition repression, which kinda would defeat the point of why I run a node!

*\[I'm planning to use SWAG\]*

I already use SWAG to frontface some stuff to a cloudflare proxy, but I plan on switching to traefik for that too, which I already use internally for SSL for stuff that isn't publicly 'presented'.  
You could add a layer of auth (+ with 2fauth on top) using Authelia eventually.


[1/2] ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bwil/ | [2/2]

*\[For this in planning to: \[...\]\]*

That's indeed a whole stack! What could be a solution would be to produce a shell script that, in a standard LXC (or even baremetal) bog standard debian, would pull all the mysterium pihole suricata etc needed sources and automatize most of the config, only asking to input the parameters needed (like the static IP, subnetIPrange/CIDR, and gateway(s) to use for the stack on the actual local network) in order to make it as secure as it should be and as beginner friendly as it advertises itself to be.

As you saw, my setup is waaaaaay simpler than that, probably also way less informed, but in a situation were I don't care about the node's 'internal' security that much, more about it not touching anything in my turf and not being used 'too' maliciously.

&#x200B;

*\[In any case I thank you for the insights, the suggestions you're giving and for volunteering to help with the repo.\]*

My *'insights'* are more just remarks/conceptions of someone who has widespread but sparse understanding/knowledge, with a lot of holes.  
I saw stuff that seemed (almost instinctively) problematic, and while I can conceptualize solutions, building a whole stack (let alone automating it) that would both be completely securely tight AND plug&play is kinda beyond my skills.   
I see myself further in the category of code tinkerer than actual coder, more a security enthusiast and not at all an expert.

I will indeed check out the repo, probably try it myself, report on it, eventually point out issues if I see some, but I probably won't have a complete solution to anything!

Though as I said, as soon as you're comfortable enough with your repo, I'll link it at the top of the post in an edit, so more eyes are on it, and probably some from people who are more knowledgeable and crafty than myself!  


  
*\[Looking forward to read your opinions.\]*

Yup, well, indeed it was more opinions than solutions or even insights from my part.

Looking forward to see you roast my firewall rules ;) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bzaz/ | *\[To be honest you did a great job, I'd just add blocking of malformed IP packets and rate limits for SYN and ICMP packets.\]*

Showing how much I'm not an expert, I actually never tried to do that with Proxmox's firewall, I'll have to try that!

*\[Regarding traefik, I think it is way better to stand with nginx, and especially swag that has fail2ban integrated.\]*

Fair! I just found traefik a bit easier to play with, but that's entierely personal. It's more flexible when it comes to adding removing services on the fly, doesn't need reloads or rebuilds. Hence my choice for internal SSL!

I think it's just that failtoban looses a bit of its importance when I'm hiding with cloudflare's proxy, caching and filtering.  


*\[On the VPS vs ISP: I honestly think that they are still monitored in any case.\]*

Yeah ISPs are monitored like VPS are, but residential addresses are not as blocked as datacenter IPs from a country to an other, or by platforms that geoblock.

My node is thus still available to a wider audience, with access to a wider array of services than if it was running on a VPS I think.

Also I'm kinda serving my own ends by running a node, because my internet usage from my ISP's point of view becomes an indecipherable mess of a wide array of profiles and languages mixed together, basically stopping them from building a profile.

In that way, 'being a VPN' can protect your identity almost as much as using one.

&#x200B;

*\[wich DNS will be used by the VPN client\]*

I'm puzzled about it too.

But I would assume they are using the DNS they are configured with on their machine, since I haven't seen (or else missed it) custom DNS options in the VPN's code ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwehrap/ | 1. no. I'm running mine in an LXC debian container with as available resources 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor, and 128mb of ram. A session just finished at this moment after 23h58 with \~445GB transfered, and the node didn't even touched half its resources. It's not resource intensive at all.
2. yes. you will be better placed to have clients who will send/receive lots of data. 1GB earns you almost as much as 200hours of session. Ping can also matter to some clients.
3. Not on the same IP, I doubt it.
4. Yes. But better use IPs from different regions of the world than your neighbor's or grandma's, who ultimately have ""the same internet"" as you, same geo-locks/laws/censorships. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sojaqr/best_way_to_maximise_network_node_earnings/hw9hjua/ | Not.

The node is indeed residential, but in a virtualized environment, with a firewall applying to it from outside its container.  
If you're curious about security, I had a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) where I had a configuration issue outside the box and quite a bit of discussion in the comments.

And since I'm not on whitelist, be conscious I may be taking a bit of a risk.

&#x200B;

Other than that, we are at 275GB on this session at the moment I'm writing, the container still doesn't use more resources, still at 62MiB of used memory. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw7pqfi/ | I can't give you a straight answer, the previous ""long session"" I had was a 19hours long from Japan who transferred \~750mB, and I had a dozen of ""short sessions"" who did about 100 to 500mB.  
Key points:

\- I'm on a 2Gbps down 600mbps up connection

\- I have low ping

\- My node's self-test indicates it is 'Full cone', so I am as reachable as possible (while with docker container I could only achieve Symmetric Nat restricted cone, surely due to how my network and hosts are structured)

\- Clearly allocated resources don't matter. Allocated 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor and 128mb of ram of RAM to the debian LXC container, the average use of these both was under half the total allocation for the whole 23h58 session, and the few CPU spikes weren't above 80-90%... so 8-9% of a 9th 35WTDP cpu.

&#x200B;

So I don't know how I attracted them, but I guess what made them stay was stability, throughput and ping? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hweiqdt/ | Well, running myst bare metal is indeed more risky than running it in a container if anything goes wrong or miss-configured.

I will give you under what 'advices' I can, keep in mind I'm not a security expert, just a tinkerer, and I'm not above making mistakes when giving advices either, it's to give you a 'guideline' idea!

Taking a raspberry Pi as an example, given how little resources the node uses, it's a bit of a waste of a Pi to just run the node on it.

So the idea would be to have the Mysterium node running in docker and segregated from your other docker containers that you then could run on your PI, and also segregated from your network.

* Without going too deep into it, here's what my recommendations would be for a rasp-pi node:
* install bog-standard raspbian
* install docker
* go for a docker container installation of myst instead of bare metal.

It being in docker means you can also more easily set up firewall rules for the container outside of the container, which means that if anything goes wrong **within** the Mysterium container, in all logic it shouldn't be able to bypass your firewall rules or touch your host so long it's an unprivileged container.

The bare minimum rules to protect your network would be the following, assuming your IP range is 192.168.0.0/24 (aka 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255, and your gateway(router) is 192.168.0.1):

Create a network bridge in docker that will let the container have its own IP:

    $docker network create -d macvlan --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range 192.168.0.128/31 --gateway 192.168.0.1 -o parent=eth0 br0docker

(I leave it the possibility to take ip 192.168.0.128 or 192.168.0.129 to avoid possible conflicts, but you can reduce it to one with /32, or expend the range)

&#x200B;

Create an IPset that represents your local network, minus your gateway:

    $ipset create lan-gw hash:net comment
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.0/24 comment ""lan IP range""
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.1/32 nomatch comment ""gateway""

And one that represent the IPs your node may have:

    $ipset create mystip hash:net comment
    $ipset add mystip 192.168.0.128/31 comment ""mystip""

And one of the IPs on your lan that you want to allow accessing the node's webui:

    $ipset create mystwebui hash:net
    $ipset add mystwebui 192.168.0.24/32

In the example above, only the computer on your lan using the  192.168.1.24 will be able to reach the node's webui. You can add more if needed.

The following firewall rules would be a ""minimal"" security setup imo, to protect your other devices on the network and your router from the node, while still allowing it full connectivity over the dVPN ports, and a select webui access from your chosen device:

    $iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -p tcp --dport 4449 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -j REJECT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -p udp --match multiport --dports 10000:25560,25570:60000 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -m set --match-set lan-gw dst -j DROP
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -d 192.168.0.1 -p tcp --match multiport --dports 22,80,443 -j DROP 
    $iptables --policy INPUT DROP
    $/sbin/iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

(I know -i ethX and other stuff could be used, but just trying to keep it setup-agnostic and simple, all setup change modifications would only require changes in IPset)

I advise you to read a bit about iptables and how docker can modify them, it's a headache but a necessary one.

Make sure your node always starts in docker with the following extra parameter so it gets its own IP, seperate from your Pi host, on your network for ease of portforwarding:

    $docker run --network br0docker .....

As for CLI into the container, use the docker CLI for that from your raspberryPI.

&#x200B;

I haven't done it myself so I can't tell you it's all good to go, but that would be my take on it in my head if I went to do it, if it can be of any help as a starting point.

(I run an LXC container on Proxmox instead, and even then my setup isn't perfect I'm sure). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8j91c/ | I repeat: I'm not a security expert nor anything, just a tinkerer. I might be wrong about some stuff, I may have made mistakes I'm not seeing.

Really the reason I made this answer it's less about giving you instructions to follow, more like giving you the idea/understanding of what we're trying to achieve to secure it, and the steps I imagine I would have to take to make it happen, using only tools that are well documented and recognized.

Again, I don't have a RaspPi atm, I haven't tried it on docker either.

I went for an LXC container so I could test the bare-metal native install in a containerized environment to have more control over it, reduce risks and monitor it, which achieves in essence the same concept of container+outer firewall.

Really the better advice if any that I can give you is to look and ask around, either here or on linux dedicated reddits about IPtables/IPset and Docker, and be curious to dive in documentation/tutorials made by people more knowledgeable and skilled than I am! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8xmrz/ | Well, two things:

1. you must have created the IPsets corresponding first. Ipset is a 'companion package' to iptables, be sure it's installed!

3. wait, I fucked up some synthax, gimme a moment to edit -- edited, might not be above still having left an error in, but I just had a brain-blank about how to declare source and destination properly with match-sets. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw98pkx/",

Ask questions. You’re entering clinics so take what you’re seeing  home and see where it lines up with what you were taught. Inevitably there will be differences, nuances. Why did they run that test or how did they know they didn’t need to run this other test. What told them to test for this disease first.
Why did they choose that suture closure. Is there a reason they chose that antibiotic but no culture this time but they cultured the last time ( and pray they’ve got a good answer for you)

Take every exposure as a day to reaffirm what you’re learning and springboard from.
And when you still want more, you’ll be looking for an internship and maybe even a residency|It’s tough to come into a tight group esp from out of area. It’s hard, too, to have more experience than most there and have experience that might indicate you’ve figured out better ways to do things that what this clinic is doing.
I don’t know what your approach has been as a new comer or how long you’ve actually been in this clinic.
But a couple of thoughts:
Set aside your knowledge for now as you don’t have 3 years in THIS clinic. You’re there to blend in and support and have them figure out what a wonderful addition you are. So observe, ask more questions than give comments, and listen.

Unless you’re seeing something medically dangerous, illegal or contraindicated, go with their flow till you figure out if they NEED your years of experience in that particular way. Who knows you might learn something from them too.

You may need to give your superiors a heads up of the personal attacks continue about them desiring you getting fired and replaced by the one who left. You may not know the full culture of that clinic yet and whether there is 1 person out of line or a whole messed up system.

Stay in the middle. Be a flexible team member who’s there to help THEM and their clinic in the ways they need.

We will have to wait and see where this goes.|You should see the evaluation and then pay for your own evaluation. That 15 million seems high.

I could argue you can acquire a loan for 3-5 million and purchase land and build new building and have enough business within a reasonable time. All making it cheaper to start fresh…. But you need to evaluate for yourself. Don’t be afraid to go that route.

Can’t remember if any sign on. Definitely no relocation.

6 months of supposed mentorship time.|I can’t say what the prosal money will be. I know in California and New York a lot of GPs start at (depending on experience) 130-160k and in Cali it isn’t unheard of to have base + percent = 180k to 210k+… a lot seem to work a solid 40 or more though.

Chicago, Austin Texas, Atlanta Georgia, etc are mini versions of New York imo. Where you can expect to make a decent chunk more than your average Midwest city. That is often due to high cost of living. Your Chicago and Madison Wi vet clinics will charge 350-600 for idexx senior panels bloodwork. While your average midwestern vet clinic will charge 220-320 for the same. So your percentage will be higher and you will make base plus percent easily due to clinic fees usually being higher.

In my opinion working 40 hours or more sucks. And while higher base sounds good and sure the almost guaranteed added percentage due to high clinic prices is great. It all ends up being pointless when you pay so much for rent, food, etc makes it negligible.

I’d rather live in a decent Midwest city making base 110-150 (depending on experience.) afford a home that is the same price or cheaper than Chicago rent and have equity in something substantial. Then I can sell the home after so many years and break even or gain a profit. Other factors keep me away from Chicago such as less crime, cheaper food prices, cheaper taxes, gas, the list goes. Again this is my opinion. 

Renting is not an investment. A house is.

The low cost average home in a “nice area” in Chicago where a lot of cops and teachers live will run you minimum 370k+. Average home in other parts of Midwest are more often range in the 220kish for something of similar quality with often guaranteed real estate taxes.

We will have to wait and see where this goes.|TLDR: it is probably true. To brag about getting an offer from every NVA and VCA like corporation is very silly and all vets can do that…

Covid changed our entire world.

1. Covid caused many Americans to become first time pet owners at a rapid rate we have never seen.

2. Many vets who were close to retiring did so earlier than expected. 

3. Vets with children, especially female vets, exited the industry entirely or dropped down to part time, relief work, or at home euthanasia. Allowing to take control over their lives and bringing their mental health up.

4. Colleges haven’t been producing enough vets. Specifically male rural vets. And no I am not saying that myself. This is from a Dvm 360 article written in the 2010s by a female Dvm author.

There are certainly other factors. You get the gist.

Banfield/vca, nva, and similar corporations will give you an offer regardless of anything. If you ask for an interview they will give you an offer guaranteed. Often times these offers burn you out by the 1st or 2nd year… but you will receive offers easily. I suggest advocating for higher base salary, lower hours, and other benefits. It is a employees market and don’t allow any vet clinic to tell you otherwise!

One huge issue is recruiting firms. Many naive students all over stem will be contacted by recruiters who will promise the world and deliver nothing. Recruiters are encouraged to obtain your information and get you into their database. They want to harvest your information as much as possible. Regardless of whether they can get you a job or not. It is also better not to work with one if you can. Why would a clinic want to pay a recruiter 30% of your annual salary when you can demand that 30% or close to it yourself as a sign on bonus and double dip.|I recommend therapy. You need to address your own grief before being able to handle others. This outlook is very concerning when you haven’t started your career yet. I believe in you and I hope you can believe in yourself. You are graduating and  that is an accomplishment in itself. Take pride in it!

You only fail if you haven’t tried. You will gain experience with the right clinical environment. Despite what others may say on Reddit if you look hard enough you can have clinics who will hire you for the hours of your choosing. We hear the constant complaints on this thread about negative experiences because happy people don’t need to vent.

Find a clinic who will give you longer appointments times as needed for up to 6 months. Give you longer surgery times. Allow you to shadow all surgeries before performing them yourself. And even when performing them the clinic will have a colleague to be in the room or nearby once you start tackling these procedures.

Lots of clinics won’t even let you see their crazy clients until you’re ready. And usually the crazy clients won’t trust or even want to see a new grad so it works in your favor.

At home euthanasia takes a toll. Being in a clinic and seeing brand new puppies and kittens for their first shots will bring more joy. Joy I feel you may need.|If you are not getting better with therapy you may need to assess your therapist. Not all therapists are the right fit. You definitely need to think about finding a better fit if you think you aren’t trending towards a positive mindset.

It’s okay to be nervous or overwhelmed. If you are being interviewed by fellow doctors they won’t care because they were in your shoes not so long ago. If they care that you are nervous that is a red flag that you should stay away.

2. You are unprepared. That is okay. You need to take the time to think about what you want rather than what your peers want. Peer pressure is strong. I highly suggest a quiet place for 30 minutes a day to journal what your goals are now, and every year after. Ideally you should start to establish a plan for every year that would make you happy. Your happiness is priority, the highest salary, best location, best benefits, etc are all secondary’s. The reason I say this is because I constantly see stories on this sub about burnout after 6 months to 2 years. Young vets chasing the top salaries and then being worked like Amish horses. Now wanting to leave the industry entirely.

3. Journal, journal, journal. How many hours do you want to work a week? What cities are you okay with working in? What CE do you want to go after? (I highly recommend finding a clinic who will pay for you to go to sound in Texas in year one for ultrasound. Then year two go to dental in Atlanta Georgia. Then year three write what you want in your journal of what ce next. The CE courses that cost the most often have information that vet school should have taught you. But that is another gripe for another day.)

4. Interview everywhere. Don’t trust what people say. Get it in writing. Interview at the hospital who has the same doctor owner for 20+ years. Will he teach you or will he vacation as soon as you join? Interview at the corporation. Are you meeting the hiring manager in person? Are they promising you the world but won’t give you anything in writing? Will they say you will work at only one clinic but then swap you around to three different clinics as they need?

5.my opinion - recommendation if I was you. Go to a practice where you can learn. That means finding a place with 3-5 vets. Check their schedule on their system. Make sure they book out less than a few days at time. That way you know they are busy but not too busy. Make sure the one or more vets are 2-6 years out. That way they are still practicing similar to how you were taught but have enough fun experience to help you advance quickly and make less mistakes. They can guide you through the mistakes they’ve made so you can make less. Find the appropriate salary to hourly wage. A place that won’t pressure you. A place where you are allowed to adjust your surgery time so you can take the time needed. A place where you can fire clients who cross the line and the owner will stand behind your decision to fire someone.

Zoetis hasn’t been around long enough for me to hear anything good or bad. Issue is normally supply chain/pick up issues and volume with newer companies. Abaxis was a new company and went downhill pretty fast and glad I stuck with idexx.


Idexx costs the most but gives you the least amount of headaches. I can always reach a costumer service rep. They charge if you use too many hours of service though. You’ll need to ask how much it is. Getting ahold of specialists as needed for consults is nice. I wouldn’t use idexx for X-rays consults though. Better off with AxisVet imo.

VMCAS is where you apply and all the information should be in there that you need. You should be able to make a login and browse things through there or just go to the general website. You could also look up specific school requirements online or meet with an advisor at a local college or your previous Alma mater and get some advice on where to start. You’ll need things like chem 1 and 2, orgo, calculus, so I’m sure you’ll have some done already.  While you are working on pre-requisites try to get some experience such as vet assistant work somewhere. You’ll definitely need some experience in order to get in but this being a second career you also have other life and leadership experience that other applicants don’t have. You can also apply to an island school which are probably a little bit easier to get in. More cost, but absolutely amazing experience overall. Absolutely loved living in the Caribbean!

from_the_box,"Hi there, I’m a 3rd year surgery resident! 
Everything Asleep_leopard said here is true. We’ve been through 12+ years of *you must be perfect to move forward* type education. We have never gotten off easy for a missed thing, so we’re type A and seriously anxious about the minute details because the blame always falls to us. And once we’re in practice… what you do is on our license. 

So, what we want from our team is that level of buy-in. We want you to have pride in doing your job right and understanding that whether you do it right can have an impact on patient survival, complications etc. I have so much knowledge to share, but if I have to keep explaining why it’s important and you don’t want to work to improve your own knowledge to improve our care… I will resent it. I need to trust you. If I can’t see you care and or try to improve, then I won’t trust you and will feel like I have to do it myself for safety purposes. And surgeons like doing surgery, we don’t want to do prep and anesthesia and instrument care but if we can’t trust others to do it we will and then get crusty about it. 

In return for your buy-in, I will fiercely advocate for your wellbeing, work-life balance, pay etc. that might be only me because I believe in balance over profit/cutting that one extra case can’t be an everyday thing. But good teams are worth their weight in gold. Not just figuratively but actually in surgery. Efficiency and quality = money, and I can’t cut without a team to do anesthesia and prep etc. Get paid and get out on time. Older surgeons are often not as good at that part. 

Things you can do… read some texts on surgical sterile prep and instrument care. There’s a whole chapter in Tobias (Veterinary Surgery 2nd edition) on instruments and prep and suture and whole texts on it too. Read about procedures - again, textbooks help here but so do pages online from ACVS or other clinics. There’s a book on local anesthesia if you might be learning blocks. And there are tech courses at ACVS conference and through companies to learn more. If you like surgery, negotiate with your job to send you to them. Essentially- if you can predict what we need because you know about the procedure, it will make everything flow better.|Also we are generally really interesting but introvert people. We live hard/work hard. We are normal people underneath the big scary intimidating professional title. Chat up your surgeon while they’re closing! Talk about music playlists, be a human. Ask questions about procedures. BUT if we’re concentrating or things are hairy you gotta be cool with suspending the conversation/us being brusque and short or saying *not right now*. ABC communication in emergencies (accuracy, brevity, clarity). And things can shift in an instant to *this is now very very serious*. And then 10 minutes later we’re like “so how about them Yankees?” Like we never stopped chatting. Don’t take that personally, it’s just part of the job.|Go to ACVS.org and read the residency training standards and requirements. They also have a list of approved/registered programs. You will have to move to one of these places and live there 3 years+ 
Do a paper during vet school or intern year. It will make you a better candidate in match and reduce your stress about qualifying to sit boards.

GrapefruitMango23,"31 yo female here. I agree that this topic is not nearly touched upon enough given the fact that majority of us are women! I graduated in early 2022 and started working full time as a GP vet. I got pregnant a few months after starting and continued working full time. Management and staff were extremely supportive and lightened my caseload as things became harder physically. I was able to take 4-5 months of maternity leave and currently I am back at work full time. My son is about 10 months old now. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I do agree that it slowed down my career during my time on maternity leave, but when I returned to work, I returned full force and feel that it gave me a new sense of confidence and purpose. This may differ from your experience being that I was a very fresh grad when I got pregnant with little experience out of school, but I think that you having a few years under your belt gives you an added advantage. 

Regarding whether motherhood has changed my outlook on my career and life, the answer is yes. During school and my first few months out, I was dedicated to the grind and didn’t mind staying late or putting in the extra hours. Now, I ensure that I am efficient during my day and set strict boundaries to leave work at a certain time. I still only get to see my son for about 1-2 hours when I get home to put him to bed. While this truly sucks during the workdays, I appreciate the time spent together so much more on my days off. The time feels more meaningful and I know that my son will one day understand that his mom was out there working hard for him to have a better life. 

That being said, if I had the opportunity to work part time or full time but three days a week for a similar salary, I would absolutely take it. I am interested in having more kids so we’ll see if all of this holds true! Best of luck and remember to think about the long term.",Veterinarian

Glum_Ad_6207,"AMEN! Even veterinary pathology is hard to get into ! I tried 3 times. Human medicine has a much better system for people to get training and into a field where they can be their best versus the ridiculous internship then often specialty internship and then residency if lucky system in veterinary post-graduate training.|Exactly true since internships in veterinary medicine are not a REQUIREMENT as a means of evaluating the level of knowledge and proficiency outside of the academic program before issuing a license to practice independently as they are for MDs. Physician's have been required to do at least one year of post MD training since the Flexner Reforms of the early 1900s.  The most comparable residency in human medicine is family medicine (3yrs) which was  made a specialty because studies in the mid 1960s showed even internships did not do an adequate job in preparing ""General Practice"" physicians.

A lot of these new programs are 3 year veterinary programs going year-round. Students will be burnt out by graduation.|I think the problem has always been that academics in veterinary medicine have this huge god of all medicine complex that really blinds them to understanding and learning, not only from other professionals but from anyone who is not an academic peer. They truly lack any sense of wisdom of the world or basic compassion and thus the horrible culture that results. I can only remember a few professors in veterinary school in the early 90s that were compassionate and good teachers. Most were older and had veterinary practice experience outside academia first.|Veterinary medicine really almost has no regulatory standards that have any real consequences for practitioners and the educational standards are essentially based on the past idea that a veterinary student needs  to be lectured about everything but not actually learn enough about anything specifically to be competent in doing it. Most licensed professions have much higher competency standards to earn and keep the license.|Woefully unprepared because the curriculum is obsolete in trying to prepare a veterinarian to tend to all creatures great and small. The PEW Report on Veterinary Medicine said it was obsolete in 1988 when it was published.|AMEN! Even veterinary pathology is hard to get into ! I tried 3 times. Human medicine has a much better system for people to get training and into a field where they can be their best versus the ridiculous internship then often specialty internship and then residency if lucky system in veterinary post-graduate training.|Hopefully someday veterinary schools will learn how to both educate and train students to be competent at graduation or at least adopt a post-graduate year of realistic ""training"" where skills and drills in a specific practice sector are rehearsed under the guidance of a teacher/coach to insure to the public that the doctor who becomes licensed to work independently has been thus certified to perform competently. This was what I was taught to understand what ""professional"" meant.|*I was trying to learn instead of memorize. It’s a memorization exam. You’re wasting your time trying to become a better vet through the navle.*

Thus NAVLE in no way actually measures ""real world"" competency that involves thinking, understanding and applying medical knowledge correctly. It is such a stupid exam that proves only the ability to memorize and take guesses. Much better if we adopted a multiple step exam over a few years format like physicians and engineers take to be licensed professionals.|Do you mean like how long to cook garbage before feeding it to pigs?  The problem is that the knowledge base must be deep and relevant to the area of problem solving. The NAVLE is testing for the obsolete concept of the universal veterinarian which was decided to be obsolete in the late 1980s by the Pew Study on the Veterinary Profession.|Obviously you fail to understand that specialization in particular section of veterinary medicine is needed. You are talking about the past and the obsolete veterinary curriculum we are saddled with that really only creates a superficial veneer of knowing. Dean Emeritus Peter Eyre of Virginia Tech along with others have described the issues brilliantly. Eyre suggests we follow the engineering model of education where in the development of engineers in the 19th century the different fields of engineering like civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical all came into being. We do not expect all engineers to be competent in building roads and designing  computers etc

You can find Eyre's address about the All-Purpose Veterinary Education in the Journal of Veterinary Medical Education which is free access except for the last 1-2 years of the Journal. While there, I suggest you also look at papers written by Richard Halliwell who writes papers with similar view points. Halliwell was the Dean of the Edinburgh School of Veterinary Medicine. Halliwell also wrote a wonderful article in the Canadian Veterinary Journal  in 1999 about the folly of trying to  produce omnicompetence which is impossible.  

And the answer to incompetence is better focused training in a specific sector and periodic recertification as is done for physician assistants and also done for American Board of Veterinary Practitioners who are specialized in a specific sector of practice.|If you do not comprehend that the profession has grown in complexity that  cannot realistically be taught to all veterinarians in 4 years then I doubt you are concerned that failing to allow veterinarians to focus in a limited sector has inevitably lead to mediocrity and no real measure of realistic competency other than taking a multiple choice test. Be thankful every time you fly that the standards of competency are much higher other than passing just one exam. 

And to be exact, the most generalized of practitioners in human medicine, Family Medicine, have a 3 year post -graduate program of study covering all ages  plus obstetrics and surgery. That amount of study  was determined through studies in the 1950s and 1960s showing even physicians with a required internship were not providing the best quality of practice. It is foolish to expect that 4 years of veterinary school can train someone to be competent in medicine and surgery across multiple species|I love the comments about the OP being out of touch with the profession and expecting  something more along a really professional educational experience. Yet, his points have been made for decades about the schooling from students and from some academics in the schools who do not drink the Kool-Ade and worship at the altars of the profession. And woe to the heretic who questions the unquestionable truths of veterinary medicine. 

The basic question is that following the same, archaic truths in the profession have lead to its decline. There is an arrogance in this field that makes innovation impossible because innovation requires us to thoroughly re-examine the accepted  truth in light of the new realities of new knowledge, especially the knowledge from outside our comfort zones that shows old beliefs to be obsolete. I will say we are in decline because numerous studies that called for changes in the profession over the past 5 decades have been ignored mostly because veterinarians did not think of it or it conflicted with our visions of our profession being the ""Greatest Profession of ALL"" as I continue to hear instead of acknowledging our real imperfections and working to address them.

Veterinary field is essentially mediocrity in everything except for those very few for whom things tend to work out for but those often have to make extraordinary SACRIFICES in order to get where they are and then tell everyone how wonderful their career is.

A paper delivered stated that  Mississippi State Veterinary School had listed and counted all of the course objectives over the first three years. There were 215,619 course objectives mostly from lecture courses (over 80%). That meant learning an objective every 6 minutes every day  for 3 years. They wondered if that was too much back then. Think of how much more they have added to even ""try"" to keep a curriculum relevant for all species.  

Veterinary curriculum is based on obsolete idea of graduates being universally omnicompetent in multiple species at graduation. Of course none of the educators have to be or could be.  Total intellectual dishonesty in the veterinary schools.|AMEN! Even veterinary pathology is hard to get into ! I tried 3 times. Human medicine has a much better system for people to get training and into a field where they can be their best versus the ridiculous internship then often specialty internship and then residency if lucky system in veterinary post-graduate training.|Exactly true since internships in veterinary medicine are not a REQUIREMENT as a means of evaluating the level of knowledge and proficiency outside of the academic program before issuing a license to practice independently as they are for MDs. Physician's have been required to do at least one year of post MD training since the Flexner Reforms of the early 1900s.  The most comparable residency in human medicine is family medicine (3yrs) which was  made a specialty because studies in the mid 1960s showed even internships did not do an adequate job in preparing ""General Practice"" physicians.

I can only remember a few professors in veterinary school in the early 90s that were compassionate and good teachers.

While there, I suggest you also look at papers written by Richard Halliwell who writes papers with similar view points. Halliwell was the Dean of the Edinburgh School of Veterinary Medicine. Halliwell also wrote a wonderful article in the Canadian Veterinary Journal  in 1999 about the folly of trying to  produce omnicompetence which is impossible.

Most were older and had veterinary practice experience outside academia first.|Veterinary medicine really almost has no regulatory standards that have any real consequences for practitioners and the educational standards are essentially based on the past idea that a veterinary student needs  to be lectured about everything but not actually learn enough about anything specifically to be competent in doing it. Most licensed professions have much higher competency standards to earn and keep the license.|Woefully unprepared because the curriculum is obsolete in trying to prepare a veterinarian to tend to all creatures great and small. The PEW Report on Veterinary Medicine said it was obsolete in 1988 when it was published.|AMEN! Even veterinary pathology is hard to get into ! I tried 3 times. Human medicine has a much better system for people to get training and into a field where they can be their best versus the ridiculous internship then often specialty internship and then residency if lucky system in veterinary post-graduate training.|Hopefully someday veterinary schools will learn how to both educate and train students to be competent at graduation or at least adopt a post-graduate year of realistic ""training"" where skills and drills in a specific practice sector are rehearsed under the guidance of a teacher/coach to insure to the public that the doctor who becomes licensed to work independently has been thus certified to perform competently. This was what I was taught to understand what ""professional"" meant.|*I was trying to learn instead of memorize. It’s a memorization exam. You’re wasting your time trying to become a better vet through the navle.*

Thus NAVLE in no way actually measures ""real world"" competency that involves thinking, understanding and applying medical knowledge correctly. It is such a stupid exam that proves only the ability to memorize and take guesses. Much better if we adopted a multiple step exam over a few years format like physicians and engineers take to be licensed professionals.|Do you mean like how long to cook garbage before feeding it to pigs?  The problem is that the knowledge base must be deep and relevant to the area of problem solving. The NAVLE is testing for the obsolete concept of the universal veterinarian which was decided to be obsolete in the late 1980s by the Pew Study on the Veterinary Profession.|Obviously you fail to understand that specialization in particular section of veterinary medicine is needed. You are talking about the past and the obsolete veterinary curriculum we are saddled with that really only creates a superficial veneer of knowing. Dean Emeritus Peter Eyre of Virginia Tech along with others have described the issues brilliantly. Eyre suggests we follow the engineering model of education where in the development of engineers in the 19th century the different fields of engineering like civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical all came into being. We do not expect all engineers to be competent in building roads and designing  computers etc

You can find Eyre's address about the All-Purpose Veterinary Education in the Journal of Veterinary Medical Education which is free access except for the last 1-2 years of the Journal. While there, I suggest you also look at papers written by Richard Halliwell who writes papers with similar view points. Halliwell was the Dean of the Edinburgh School of Veterinary Medicine. Halliwell also wrote a wonderful article in the Canadian Veterinary Journal  in 1999 about the folly of trying to  produce omnicompetence which is impossible.  

And the answer to incompetence is better focused training in a specific sector and periodic recertification as is done for physician assistants and also done for American Board of Veterinary Practitioners who are specialized in a specific sector of practice.|If you do not comprehend that the profession has grown in complexity that  cannot realistically be taught to all veterinarians in 4 years then I doubt you are concerned that failing to allow veterinarians to focus in a limited sector has inevitably lead to mediocrity and no real measure of realistic competency other than taking a multiple choice test. Be thankful every time you fly that the standards of competency are much higher other than passing just one exam. 

And to be exact, the most generalized of practitioners in human medicine, Family Medicine, have a 3 year post -graduate program of study covering all ages  plus obstetrics and surgery. That amount of study  was determined through studies in the 1950s and 1960s showing even physicians with a required internship were not providing the best quality of practice. It is foolish to expect that 4 years of veterinary school can train someone to be competent in medicine and surgery across multiple species|I love the comments about the OP being out of touch with the profession and expecting  something more along a really professional educational experience. Yet, his points have been made for decades about the schooling from students and from some academics in the schools who do not drink the Kool-Ade and worship at the altars of the profession. And woe to the heretic who questions the unquestionable truths of veterinary medicine. 

The basic question is that following the same, archaic truths in the profession have lead to its decline. There is an arrogance in this field that makes innovation impossible because innovation requires us to thoroughly re-examine the accepted  truth in light of the new realities of new knowledge, especially the knowledge from outside our comfort zones that shows old beliefs to be obsolete. I will say we are in decline because numerous studies that called for changes in the profession over the past 5 decades have been ignored mostly because veterinarians did not think of it or it conflicted with our visions of our profession being the ""Greatest Profession of ALL"" as I continue to hear instead of acknowledging our real imperfections and working to address them.

""**Things alter for the worse spontaneously; if they not be altered for the better designedly.""**

**Sir Francis Bacon, English philosopher and scientist**|But the field is full of unrealistic expectations and less than reasonable returns on the time almost anyone will ever put in to it. Veterinary field is essentially mediocrity in everything except for those very few for whom things tend to work out for but those often have to make extraordinary SACRIFICES in order to get where they are and then tell everyone how wonderful their career is. It is great that a few survive and thrive but the odds are against most and getting worse compared to decades ago. From my reading, I think the attrition from veterinary medicine  is from having to deal with those odds.| The 9th  Veterinary Educational Symposium was in  June1987 and they published the proceedings in the Journal of Veterinary Medical Education in the fall of 1987.

A paper delivered stated that  Mississippi State Veterinary School had listed and counted all of the course objectives over the first three years. There were 215,619 course objectives mostly from lecture courses (over 80%). That meant learning an objective every 6 minutes every day  for 3 years. They wondered if that was too much back then. Think of how much more they have added to even ""try"" to keep a curriculum relevant for all species.  

Veterinary curriculum is based on obsolete idea of graduates being universally omnicompetent in multiple species at graduation. Of course none of the educators have to be or could be.  Total intellectual dishonesty in the veterinary schools.",Other

But I don’t work GP so it hasn’t been much of a problem… so far|Wow thanks for your comment. That was very insightful. You’re right about the part that it’s probably my mind playing tricks on me and that I’m being too hard on myself. It’s so so hard to fight that battle against my own brain, especially when I’m so tired all the time. I may try to talk to my internship director but I’m scared. I don’t know what they could offer to help me feel better. I also don’t want them to feel like I’m dumping my problems onto them. I started therapy and it hasn’t really helped so far. I do want to see a Dr and hopefully get on some anti anxiety medication. 

I feel like I actually have it pretty good in my internship. The specialists are generally nice and willing to teach. We always work with another admitting vet on ER. We mostly get 2 days off a week. But somehow that makes me feel worse? Like if I can barely survive this internship then I really must not be cut out for this haha. Also, We do have a lot of didactics which is great but at the same time a huge struggle for me. It’s hard to prepare for presentations when I just crash on my days off. 

In regards to mistakes, I’ve definitely made big ones. I’ve sent a dog home on ER that I diagnosed with IMHA without any pred after they declined admission. They ended up coming back, was admitted, threw a clot, was euthanized. I misdiagnosed CHF and rounded the case to the ECC specialist, he had to tell the owner it wasn’t actually CHF. In general on ER, I have no idea what I’m doing or what I’m saying to the owners. I feel so bad because they could be getting better care if another vet saw their pet.|I’m going to message you if that’s okay!|Is 6 month slump a thing?? Also, I’m grateful that my internship has didactics, but all of that is starting to feel overwhelming!! There’s only so much work I feel like can be done at home in my time off before I start to lose it. 

Some little mistakes like making typos in discharges and forgetting to confirm med doses with the owners on specialty rotations. Then some big ones on ER like not prescribing pred when the owners elected outpatient management for an immune mediated disease. Diagnosing CHF and rounding the case to our ECC specialist when it wasn’t CHF (I had already told the owners it was).

I've also seen some say an LVT wasn't an LVT bc they had been outta practice for a while and were rusty on skills. Any excuse to be 'better than.' like crabs in a bucket. It's dumb.

Sufficient_Daikon_59,"I’m not a vet, but my father is so although I can’t speak on the direct impact, I’ve seen/witnessed it.

It’s definitely an emotionally taxing job, but you already know that. There’s times my dad has come home from work and we won’t really be able to talk to him because he’s upset from something from work, for example, having to witness children’s agony upon learning about their sick pet. 

Other times he will come home with over-the-top gifts from people whose animals he saved. 

I guess from how I see it, being a vet is being a hero. That’s your job. People will expect that of you, and if you can’t provide it they may be extremely angry and cruel because they expected you to fix everything. But if you can, they will be grateful beyond grateful.",Other

u/calliopeReddit is right about the Miller’s knot though for sure.|You’ve asking two wildly different questions here and I’m reading it as if you put them on equal ground as far as what concerns you.

Cost of exam varies greatly by geography and no one can give you a real answer without that info. Having said that, I would consider anything around $100 for an exam as normal and acceptable. If you are in a free market, your clients will (should) determine if they are getting value for their money for the service they receive and go somewhere else if they aren’t.

For the cremation question, I agree that manager is either:
A) A raging asshole to begin with and this is par for their personality or
B) Suffering from some level of burnout.

Either way they are not making decisions that are in the best interest of the client or the clinic in this case|You may both be having a hard time adapting to a new working relationship.

You’ll need to sit down with them to hash this out and be clear from the outset what each of your roles are in the hierarchy. If you are both equal under a regional manager, make sure you explicitly state that and that they acknowledge it.

If you don’t feel comfortable with this conversation one-on-one or just want another party there to make sure there is no misunderstanding going on, invite your regional director to sit in|Can you be a vet assistant without a degree? Yes

Do they make good money? No

Many of us started out as kennel assistants (I’m a vet and I started as a volunteer kennel helper at a clinic)|If you’re planning to practice in US/Canada, super annoying doesn’t begin to describe getting licensed from a non-accredited school. The process is >$10k and can take years.

For me, I’d pick a school that teaches in my primary language. Other than those 2 things, it can be a great experience|What part of the world are you in? I know some systems start a 6-yr program after high school to encompass undergrad prereqs and then vet school.

If you’re in a traditional North American system, in what reality is this “starting late”. Although not required, most are going to get a 4-year degree prior to starting vet school. Graduate high school at 19 and undergrad at 23. On top of that, how many of us get in on our first year applying? I was lucky enough to get in on my second year of applications and counted that as a win.

TL;DR - You’re fine|Things that may help you decide:

-Google veterinary suicide rate. Even jobs that have a good work-life balance are going to have some notable stress. There are certainly alternative career paths (ones that deal less with the general public) but you still have the stress of vet school to get through

-Get experience working in as many different fields of veterinary medicine as you can

-Research entrance requirements for the vet schools you may be interested. You can tailor your college path to focus on what they are looking for and still have options after if you change your mind or aren’t able to get in|It’s (generally) not a thing.

But… anything is possible in a free market if employer and employee agree on it. 

What was the associate’s duties when they were hired? If I hired a vet and told them that they were going to do surgery and appointments, they could ask all they want later to do just surgery but that’s not going to happen. The only way that can work is if there are enough surgeries for them to generate the revenue needed to justify their salaries and they aren’t poaching surgery time from colleagues that also want to do surgery.|What a dysfunctional mess. 

I will say, my office manager is not my boss. If I signed on with the owner to do surgeries only, they could bitch and moan all they wanted about nobody taking walkins and it wouldn’t phase me. I’d tell them no and if they’ve got a problem with it they can take it up with THE boss.

If what they are saying is true that is|I guess it depends on the individual and the school.

The pass rate for NAVLE at my alma matar is around 97%. I don’t think it’s ever gotten down to 95%.

A fail rate of 20% would be bad enough but no accredited school would have a fail rate of 40%. Schools have to maintain a pass rate of at least 80% by the time of graduation to maintain their accreditation.

If your friend goes to a non-accredited school, I suppose it’s possible. That would certainly be a shitty school if that were the case.

My classmates were very supportive as were my professors. I was by no means an exceptional student and I passed easily thanks in large part to those supports.

Generally to answer your question, I know it’s (on average) harder to get into vet school than med school but never got the impression from the MDs I know that the curriculum was intrinsically more rigorous|No|Clarification: Do they call every other doctor “Dr”?

I have become a long-term Ambassador for Mysterium Network a few days ago and I support this project as much as I can. VPN is a hot item and needed in many counties that block their citizens from the internet. Mysterium should spend more time and money with advertising about this. I was on Instagram just a few hours ago and I saw an advertisement about VPN Nederland (VPN The Netherlands). This advertisement should have been about Mysterium. Also the public needs to know about $MYST and how it is used to 'feed' the VPN servers (Nodes) and services. Also very important is to mention what the actual costs are for Mysterium Network VPN. Give samples like when you send 50 emails what this cost, watch a video of 20 minutes etc etc ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ts51dt/are_node_runnersusers_happy_with_the_recent_major/i2t0f35/",Other
turowski,"I have used the [Midmark Canis Major](https://www.pattersonvet.com/Supplies/ProductFamilyDetails/PIF_36104) scale/exam table combo at a previous employer.  They are GREAT, but priced accordingly (somewhere around $10K per unit).|I reported the /r/mildlyinfuriating/ post for sharing personal information, harassment, and threatening violence and just received a response that the post was already reviewed and will not be removed (just locked).

Absolutely infuriating.  The dog very well could have microscopic disease that compromised the integrity of its femur, and at any rate, none of the clinic employees deserve the threats of physical violence that some of the smooth-brained armchair quarterbacks over there were recommending.

People wonder why they have trouble finding a vet anymore.  I hope the team at that hospital finds the Reddit post and attaches it to the poor dog's records so the next vet knows what they are getting into.

At least the dog is no longer suffering.|Don't stick a lavender-topped tube more than once.  The first aliquot of added blood consumes the anticoagulant, and it's much easier to get microclots (or real clots) in blood added subsequently.

If you have inadequate sample volume to fill the tube appropriately, then the small ""exotics"" EDTA tubes can be game-changers.  Downside is most reference labs charge for them, while the standard size tubes are usually free.  Still, it's useful to have a few on hand for old cats, kittens, chihuahuas, etc. even if you don't see exotics.|We are test-driving the Purevax combo FVRCP + rabies and the 3-year Purevax rabies; I'd been looking for a way to test the waters and see how many of our clients would spring for a 3-year Purevax over the 1-year (NB - it's about triple the list price per dose for the 3-year versus the 1-year).

I cut a very-suspicious-for-vaccine-associated-sarcoma tumor from a cat last week, tripled in size since October and dirty margins even though I went all the way to the body wall.  The cat got an Imrab rabies vaccine in May 2021 (from a shot clinic), and I'm guessing it was right over the epaxials (not on the limb), because that's where I removed the tumor.

It would take a LOT for me to give an adjuvanted rabies vaccine to a cat in light of that surgery.  And if *really* had to use one, I'd be *damn* sure to give them as distally on the limb as I could.

I don't think ""backorder of the 1-year non-adjuvanted vaccine"" would be a reasonable excuse to skip vaccination.  Human health/rabies exposures/zoonosis still have to be considered as a possible consequence if we let vaccines lapse.|I absolutely agree that new grads should be paid a flat salary rather than a production percentage.  Early in your career, you should be focusing on applying what you learned in vet school to real world cases, and your employer should be focused on training and mentoring you.  All of those processes (when done successfully) take time away from your caseload and therefore negatively affect productivity.

But, if you insist, then standard 21% production means you should be bringing in between about $480K/year in receipts (for $100K salary) and $720K/year (for $150K salary), which is close to the salary range we typically offer new grads.  Individual hospitals will have differing policies on which line items count toward production - frequently, things like prescription diets, technician appointments, and medication refills are excluded from that total.  Veterinarians who perform surgery and dentals will generally have an easier time making those production goals, although it can be done with a busy medical-only schedule.

Good luck in your career development!|It's not really that different from a pervasive attitude in human medicine - a pill to treat symptoms of a disease is often preferred to intentional, inconvenient lifestyle changes that may fix the problem altogether.",Other

Ok-Chemistry-6354,"Hey! Well it’s just the first attempt and trust me when I say it takes at least one attempt to figure out what this exam is truly like. I have definitely been in your shoes and not passed it and felt like a complete downer. But this is the time when you pick yourself up and just go for it cause you definitely have it in you!! So as I said honestly my number one advice would be to reflect on the exam. See the report and see what areas did you lack in and even how did you feel during the exam (for example, what did you feel like you knew well or lacked on). Now I did vetprep 100% and still failed my first attempt, and when I reflect back I realised I was so focused on completing my percent, I didn’t actually retain the information. So try to reflect back and see how did vetprep apply to exam questions and what did you lack. Hope that helps! Please let me know if there is any other way I can help you :)",Other

I started as a kennel, with a good practice, & supportive HR & managers/supervisors, if you state your goals and aspirations, most places will want to help you achieve that.

Good luck & i hope everything works out :)|Hi!!! When i was interviewed as kennel , it was less about the job experience you have, more on how you handle certain situations. questions such as “how have you handled a conflict in the workplace” “how comfortable are you working with difficult animals” “what would you do in a situation like…”, and “how comfortable are you with euthanasia”. During your interview include your aspirations to become a vet, and how grateful you are to have the opportunity to meet with your interviewers since this a great step to work towards your future career. be confident with everything you say. ask questions! “is the schedule fixed or does it rotate?” “is their room for growth? Id love to learn CSR (customer service rep) / VA (veterinarian assistant)…” etc . Good luck OP!! i hope everything works out :)|oh my gosh, i forgot today was friday.

How has she done in interviews? Maybe she could ask for more feedback? Good luck.|\^Yeah I second KittyKat's theory. I'm sure if she was able to land an interview, she'd nail it considering her prior experience and work ethic.

The darker colors show SO much hair. But it's a trade off because I love the sturdy material, the way they stretch, and the price point. Just get that lint roller ready fasho.

I've tried uniform advantage also. I thought they shrunk a bit in the dryer and the colors faded quickly. But while they were new, but I liked the flattering fit and buttery fabric so much they were a staple in my rotation. 

Cherokee infinity was the most polyester-feeling of these three brands imo. They were also the least clingy and most...flowy? Idk if that makes sense. I liked them when working on hot days and thought they held up well despite being thinner.

I'm on the shorter side, size M if that makes a difference idk. Good luck choosing :) I'd recommend going to a store to feel the fabrics in person or asking your coworkers what they wear as well.",Other

I know it would be extremely hard work and maybe unrealistic but that’s my motivation right now. 

Do you have a suggestion on how to work at a clinic without being a technician? Most i’ve seen around me ask for technicians or veterinarians. I could maybe look for customer service roles but I’m not sure that would help me learn what actually goes on.

Edit: not sure why this is getting down voted. Anyone want to clue me in?|I have been helping run a shelter diversion program through my local animal shelter as a volunteer and dedicating A LOT of hours to that. it’s definitely helpful and I also have volunteered at the shelter doing dog walking and enrichment and kennel clean out work. As well as fostering at rescues.

My city as well as i’m sure many other cities are in a major crisis with dog (and cat, but mostly dog) over population and it’s insane. It feels like the shelter and the diversion program is doing a lot and as much as it can and it just gets worse and worse. Honestly my dream would be to be a veterinary who gets grants to do free spay/neuter surgeries possibly from a mobile clinic and literally go street to street and do the surgeries right then and there. 

I know that sounds crazy and maybe unattainable but all the other work i’ve been doing feels so hopeless if the problem just keeps getting worse. A couple of the programs offer very limited free spay/neuter spots that go very fast and even then some people either aren’t willing or have no means of transportation. Then months later they’re calling saying they have 14 puppies they can’t care for and surrender :(. It’s just such an overwhelming problem and I feel like if i’m able to do a second job with that type of accreditation for free or get grants to pay me then maybe I can help. 

The above is just one example out of many that leads to this idea I’m just trying to help as much as I can. So many people can’t afford the vet care and end up with unwanted litters or if I could even just help educate and offer low cost options then more people might take it instead of producing so many more animals we don’t need. I don’t blame veterinarians for the prices they charge they deserve high pay as well as their staff but if i’m willing to help provide another option I want to.

I also think we need laws passed to help the problem but all I can do in that regard is vote and advocate for change.|cool i’ll definitely look in to it! I saw Purdue offers an online part time technician program where you can do clinical hours at a local vet and never have to go to their campus. I might do that at some point so I can work my current job while getting this education and experience. I would love to try and work for a place that would cover the costs for me!|i think i worded that poorly i was meaning that i would have to at least become a tech or veterinarian to help out. That having neither of those hasn’t been very helpful in comparison to what I could do if I had the license for either of them. Many of the volunteer opportunities near me ask for a tech or veterinary for certain events and I obviously am not qualified to help if I am not either of those things. 

I have spent time in a shelter clinic but only as a volunteer. I wouldn’t know how else I could spend time in one without becoming a tech or maybe a front desk admin person but that would require taking a day job when i already have one.

Edited to add: I know techs definitely do a lot and are valuable! Any experience i’ve had, the vet techs actually do more at the practice and do a lot of hard labor and it seems like an extremely difficult and under appreciated job. Wanted to make that clear! I just meant i have to at least do some kind of license to make more of a difference.|I don’t think i’m passionate about rescue per se as being the only focus. I’ve found some rescue organizations near me demonize the city shelter for their euthanasia rate when it’s true that we can’t save them all. I’m passionate about trying to fix the root cause of the overpopulation problem that creates the need for rescues to exist. I love rescues and the very important work that they do. But I want to be part of the solution and TNR and spay/neuter dogs at a low cost BEFORE rescues get called to take in 13 “unexpected” puppies and 5 bottle baby kittens found in the street. And the 30 adult dogs that were found running stray unaltered in 1 day alone. 

I know there are root causes beyond that like education and local laws that could be passed to help. But if I don’t have control over policies in my city except for my vote, then I want to try and do something that I can have control over.|Cool! Did you take pre reqs for vet school or did you become a vet tech first then become a vet? I like my data analysis career but feel like I want to make a bigger impact on the world and see my work actually make a difference.|that’s kind of where i’m at. Great money but so burnt out already and I want to do something more meaningful.|Yes lots of great points. My main motivation is to prevent and reduce overpopulation. My city shelter euthanizes dogs because of how bad it is and I fully support their decisions to euthanize for the sake of the dogs and they go insane in their kennels for long periods of time and deteriorate fast. I would support them even if they had to euthanize at a higher rate than they currently do because it’s so bad and is unfortunately necessary. I would definitely support euthanasia if the animal would suffer otherwise. 

The organization I currently support covers emergency care in cases like you mentioned where the owner can’t afford it but of course we can’t help everyone. I want to prevent all of the unwanted dogs and not have such a huge stray dog problem with a shelter that is at capacity 24/7 so they are unable to help. And the vast majority of their intakes are all unaltered. So really my focus would be solely spay/neuter and less about the other medical treatment. 

However everyone makes good points where maybe I could assist organizations with grant writing and data analytics to increase their ability to provide low cost options. I just find some organizations like that cannot get the actual veterinarian or technician to work there because of low pay and many other factors. 

I’m just trying to find ways I can help the crisis as best as I can.|I’ve definitely seen the toxicity in volunteer work so far and through my friends stories who are techs. It’s just hard to actually get that experience without sinking money into being a tech first it feels like that’s the only way. Unless anywhere ever needs like unlicensed assistance that can’t really do much work outside of what i’ve already done as a volunteer. But i’ll keep trying to get more involved.|I make good money now and already paid off all my student loans from my other two degrees. That’s why I might do the part time tech school program to continue working my other job and just pay out of pocket. Then do part time shelter work as a tech and evaluate from there if I want to drop more money on being a veterinarian that could do something like that. 

I agree that is how the low cost programs work. I actually have done grant writing to get grants for the non profit I volunteer for and we pay for vet care for those who can’t afford it and those grants pay the salary for the director which is, yep you guessed it, a low salary. My masters degree had a focus on nonprofit financials so I have experience there. I fully understand it wouldn’t be a money maker or easy to live on if I did that full time.

That’s why it might just be a pipe dream. But I think maybe becoming a tech would be a good first step to see if the long term goal might be able to happen. Thanks for the info and hard questions! A lot to think about and consider!|Nice! I hope it’s going well for you! I think i’m going to go that route because I could get some experience to see if I would want to invest more into schooling to become a vet. By veterinarian corporate do you mean one of the bigger name clinics but you work for their corporate headquarters instead of a in clinic job directly?|ok i can look for that. I’ve done kennel cleaning at the local shelter as well as helping move animals to the medical room and transporting when needed. I’ll keep looking for more experience before deciding if I want to put money towards schooling to be either a technician or veterinarian.|that’s a good point. I do love the advances in vet medical research that have been life saving. For example in 2021 I treated my family cat for FIP and saved his life. I would love to support the continued research on that and get the right things done to make it a legal practice. But I wouldn’t love performing the actual medical procedures myself except for the fact that I know it’s helping the animal or making a difference. 
I will continue to explore options to get more involved but as I mentioned in another comment I want to help be a solution to the over population problem that is causing burn out in the city shelter and rescues. Thanks for the great input!|it’s USAJobs.gov ***** not usajobs.com but i think it redirects there if you type it in.|it’s USAJobs.gov ***** not usajobs.com but i think it redirects there if you type it in.|I would be interested in either starting a non-profit or working for one instead of a typical for profit clinic.

I like my data analysis career but feel like I want to make a bigger impact on the world and see my work actually make a difference.|that’s kind of where i’m at. Great money but so burnt out already and I want to do something more meaningful.|Yes lots of great points. My main motivation is to prevent and reduce overpopulation. My city shelter euthanizes dogs because of how bad it is and I fully support their decisions to euthanize for the sake of the dogs and they go insane in their kennels for long periods of time and deteriorate fast. I would support them even if they had to euthanize at a higher rate than they currently do because it’s so bad and is unfortunately necessary. I would definitely support euthanasia if the animal would suffer otherwise. 

The organization I currently support covers emergency care in cases like you mentioned where the owner can’t afford it but of course we can’t help everyone. I want to prevent all of the unwanted dogs and not have such a huge stray dog problem with a shelter that is at capacity 24/7 so they are unable to help. And the vast majority of their intakes are all unaltered. So really my focus would be solely spay/neuter and less about the other medical treatment. 

However everyone makes good points where maybe I could assist organizations with grant writing and data analytics to increase their ability to provide low cost options. I just find some organizations like that cannot get the actual veterinarian or technician to work there because of low pay and many other factors. 

I’m just trying to find ways I can help the crisis as best as I can.|I’ve definitely seen the toxicity in volunteer work so far and through my friends stories who are techs. It’s just hard to actually get that experience without sinking money into being a tech first it feels like that’s the only way.

But i’ll keep trying to get more involved.|I make good money now and already paid off all my student loans from my other two degrees. That’s why I might do the part time tech school program to continue working my other job and just pay out of pocket. Then do part time shelter work as a tech and evaluate from there if I want to drop more money on being a veterinarian that could do something like that. 

I agree that is how the low cost programs work. I actually have done grant writing to get grants for the non profit I volunteer for and we pay for vet care for those who can’t afford it and those grants pay the salary for the director which is, yep you guessed it, a low salary. My masters degree had a focus on nonprofit financials so I have experience there. I fully understand it wouldn’t be a money maker or easy to live on if I did that full time.

Edit: not sure why this is getting down voted. Anyone want to clue me in?|I have been helping run a shelter diversion program through my local animal shelter as a volunteer and dedicating A LOT of hours to that. it’s definitely helpful and I also have volunteered at the shelter doing dog walking and enrichment and kennel clean out work.

My city as well as i’m sure many other cities are in a major crisis with dog (and cat, but mostly dog) over population and it’s insane. It feels like the shelter and the diversion program is doing a lot and as much as it can and it just gets worse and worse. Honestly my dream would be to be a veterinary who gets grants to do free spay/neuter surgeries possibly from a mobile clinic and literally go street to street and do the surgeries right then and there. 

I know that sounds crazy and maybe unattainable but all the other work i’ve been doing feels so hopeless if the problem just keeps getting worse. A couple of the programs offer very limited free spay/neuter spots that go very fast and even then some people either aren’t willing or have no means of transportation. Then months later they’re calling saying they have 14 puppies they can’t care for and surrender :(. It’s just such an overwhelming problem and I feel like if i’m able to do a second job with that type of accreditation for free or get grants to pay me then maybe I can help. 

The above is just one example out of many that leads to this idea I’m just trying to help as much as I can. So many people can’t afford the vet care and end up with unwanted litters or if I could even just help educate and offer low cost options then more people might take it instead of producing so many more animals we don’t need. I don’t blame veterinarians for the prices they charge they deserve high pay as well as their staff but if i’m willing to help provide another option I want to.

I also think we need laws passed to help the problem but all I can do in that regard is vote and advocate for change.|cool i’ll definitely look in to it!

I don’t blame veterinarians for the prices they charge they deserve high pay as well as their staff but if i’m willing to help provide another option I want to.

I also think we need laws passed to help the problem but all I can do in that regard is vote and advocate for change.|cool i’ll definitely look in to it! I saw Purdue offers an online part time technician program where you can do clinical hours at a local vet and never have to go to their campus. I might do that at some point so I can work my current job while getting this education and experience. I would love to try and work for a place that would cover the costs for me!|i think i worded that poorly i was meaning that i would have to at least become a tech or veterinarian to help out. That having neither of those hasn’t been very helpful in comparison to what I could do if I had the license for either of them. Many of the volunteer opportunities near me ask for a tech or veterinary for certain events and I obviously am not qualified to help if I am not either of those things. 

I have spent time in a shelter clinic but only as a volunteer. I wouldn’t know how else I could spend time in one without becoming a tech or maybe a front desk admin person but that would require taking a day job when i already have one.

Edited to add: I know techs definitely do a lot and are valuable! Any experience i’ve had, the vet techs actually do more at the practice and do a lot of hard labor and it seems like an extremely difficult and under appreciated job. Wanted to make that clear! I just meant i have to at least do some kind of license to make more of a difference.|I don’t think i’m passionate about rescue per se as being the only focus. I’ve found some rescue organizations near me demonize the city shelter for their euthanasia rate when it’s true that we can’t save them all. I’m passionate about trying to fix the root cause of the overpopulation problem that creates the need for rescues to exist. I love rescues and the very important work that they do. But I want to be part of the solution and TNR and spay/neuter dogs at a low cost BEFORE rescues get called to take in 13 “unexpected” puppies and 5 bottle baby kittens found in the street. And the 30 adult dogs that were found running stray unaltered in 1 day alone. 

I know there are root causes beyond that like education and local laws that could be passed to help. But if I don’t have control over policies in my city except for my vote, then I want to try and do something that I can have control over.|Cool! Did you take pre reqs for vet school or did you become a vet tech first then become a vet? I like my data analysis career but feel like I want to make a bigger impact on the world and see my work actually make a difference.|that’s kind of where i’m at. Great money but so burnt out already and I want to do something more meaningful.|Yes lots of great points. My main motivation is to prevent and reduce overpopulation. My city shelter euthanizes dogs because of how bad it is and I fully support their decisions to euthanize for the sake of the dogs and they go insane in their kennels for long periods of time and deteriorate fast. I would support them even if they had to euthanize at a higher rate than they currently do because it’s so bad and is unfortunately necessary. I would definitely support euthanasia if the animal would suffer otherwise. 

The organization I currently support covers emergency care in cases like you mentioned where the owner can’t afford it but of course we can’t help everyone. I want to prevent all of the unwanted dogs and not have such a huge stray dog problem with a shelter that is at capacity 24/7 so they are unable to help. And the vast majority of their intakes are all unaltered. So really my focus would be solely spay/neuter and less about the other medical treatment. 

However everyone makes good points where maybe I could assist organizations with grant writing and data analytics to increase their ability to provide low cost options. I just find some organizations like that cannot get the actual veterinarian or technician to work there because of low pay and many other factors. 

I’m just trying to find ways I can help the crisis as best as I can.|I’ve definitely seen the toxicity in volunteer work so far and through my friends stories who are techs. It’s just hard to actually get that experience without sinking money into being a tech first it feels like that’s the only way. Unless anywhere ever needs like unlicensed assistance that can’t really do much work outside of what i’ve already done as a volunteer. But i’ll keep trying to get more involved.|I make good money now and already paid off all my student loans from my other two degrees. That’s why I might do the part time tech school program to continue working my other job and just pay out of pocket. Then do part time shelter work as a tech and evaluate from there if I want to drop more money on being a veterinarian that could do something like that. 

I agree that is how the low cost programs work. I actually have done grant writing to get grants for the non profit I volunteer for and we pay for vet care for those who can’t afford it and those grants pay the salary for the director which is, yep you guessed it, a low salary. My masters degree had a focus on nonprofit financials so I have experience there. I fully understand it wouldn’t be a money maker or easy to live on if I did that full time.

That’s why it might just be a pipe dream. But I think maybe becoming a tech would be a good first step to see if the long term goal might be able to happen. Thanks for the info and hard questions! A lot to think about and consider!|Nice! I hope it’s going well for you! I think i’m going to go that route because I could get some experience to see if I would want to invest more into schooling to become a vet. By veterinarian corporate do you mean one of the bigger name clinics but you work for their corporate headquarters instead of a in clinic job directly?|ok i can look for that. I’ve done kennel cleaning at the local shelter as well as helping move animals to the medical room and transporting when needed. I’ll keep looking for more experience before deciding if I want to put money towards schooling to be either a technician or veterinarian.|that’s a good point. I do love the advances in vet medical research that have been life saving. For example in 2021 I treated my family cat for FIP and saved his life. I would love to support the continued research on that and get the right things done to make it a legal practice. But I wouldn’t love performing the actual medical procedures myself except for the fact that I know it’s helping the animal or making a difference. 
I will continue to explore options to get more involved but as I mentioned in another comment I want to help be a solution to the over population problem that is causing burn out in the city shelter and rescues. Thanks for the great input!|it’s USAJobs.gov ***** not usajobs.com but i think it redirects there if you type it in.|it’s USAJobs.gov ***** not usajobs.com but i think it redirects there if you type it in.|I would be interested in either starting a non-profit or working for one instead of a typical for profit clinic. I know it would be extremely hard work and maybe unrealistic but that’s my motivation right now. 

Do you have a suggestion on how to work at a clinic without being a technician? Most i’ve seen around me ask for technicians or veterinarians. I could maybe look for customer service roles but I’m not sure that would help me learn what actually goes on.

Edit: not sure why this is getting down voted. Anyone want to clue me in?|I have been helping run a shelter diversion program through my local animal shelter as a volunteer and dedicating A LOT of hours to that. it’s definitely helpful and I also have volunteered at the shelter doing dog walking and enrichment and kennel clean out work. As well as fostering at rescues.

My city as well as i’m sure many other cities are in a major crisis with dog (and cat, but mostly dog) over population and it’s insane. It feels like the shelter and the diversion program is doing a lot and as much as it can and it just gets worse and worse. Honestly my dream would be to be a veterinary who gets grants to do free spay/neuter surgeries possibly from a mobile clinic and literally go street to street and do the surgeries right then and there. 

I know that sounds crazy and maybe unattainable but all the other work i’ve been doing feels so hopeless if the problem just keeps getting worse. A couple of the programs offer very limited free spay/neuter spots that go very fast and even then some people either aren’t willing or have no means of transportation. Then months later they’re calling saying they have 14 puppies they can’t care for and surrender :(. It’s just such an overwhelming problem and I feel like if i’m able to do a second job with that type of accreditation for free or get grants to pay me then maybe I can help. 

The above is just one example out of many that leads to this idea I’m just trying to help as much as I can. So many people can’t afford the vet care and end up with unwanted litters or if I could even just help educate and offer low cost options then more people might take it instead of producing so many more animals we don’t need.

SciFiInsomniac,"Hey there! I'm glad you're looking out for pet owners. Just my thoughts here, but if anything, maybe contact her directly with concerns that some information isn't accurate.

Unfortunately, pet owners get a LOT of bad advice from the internet, friends, groomers, breeders, commercials, etc. It's up to them to find a reputable source. All in all, I wouldn't hurt your own reputation by making a big deal out of it.

I'm sure there will be other opinions on here!",Other
urgentbog,"From Dashboard there is a tab called Time Clock. I think, it’s on the far right of all the Dashboard tabs for me. Click the plus symbol (+) and the pop up window will have the current time, go ahead and save the clock in. Doing this from memory, so descriptions may not be accurate sorry. As others said can always ask coworkers. Also, I know my clinic didn’t use EzyVet for clocking hours when I started and I don’t think any clocking functions were available at that time. Your user file may not be set up for clocking which will require assistance from a manager.",Other

ykkemykke,"It's okay to change your mind and do something else. Go shadow and see if you like it. If you like it, that's great and now you know. If not, that's fine. There are many other jobs in the world where you can work with animals but not necessarily have the responsibilities and decisions to make like a vet. It's a wonderful profession, but it's also mentally taxing. One of my classmates in vet school dropped out the first semester because she realized she couldn't make the medical decisions for an animal without being very emotionally involved, and that's totally understandable. But there are so many other jobs you can have and work with animals!",Other

hs5280,"Vetmed is a team sport. I’ve worked with doctors I don’t necessarily trust fully but that doesn’t mean I’d be rude to them. I’m a support for them and I do what I can to help their confidence. How are we going to improve the mental health of the doctors and techs in this field if we continue to talk to each other like that? From day one it’s a learning process and we never stop!|Tech at a veg in New Jersey here. Fresh out of school, you’ll be in the “new er doctor” program and if you’re willing to devote your life to it short term, and you love ER work and surgery, you’ll probably like it. Doctors work 12 hour shifts, but does anyone ever leave on time - probably not. I believe the current contracts are 12 shifts per month. Doctors rotate so you’ll have day, swing, and night shifts. 

It’s kind of location dependent about how you’ll be treated by current staff, what your mentors will be like, how hard you have to go into the cult stuff, etc. Ive seen some new doctors say “nope” early on, and I’ve seen some grow into amazing doctors who can run an ER floor like a boss. 

The fact that we don’t take people away from their pets is something that really doesn’t change much of what you do. I know a lot of people are reticent to practice that way, but it really keeps them calmer not having to wait outside for the most part. And when an animal does better away from their family, you have every right to say so. 

If you end up with veg, when you get there trust your support staff. They’re well trained and can guide you through the hospital specific things that the overarching cult indoctrination doesn’t give.|As far as practicing medicine the way you want, there’s a lot of autonomy once you’re on your own as a solo doctor. There’s also a lot of resources to confer with others when you get a mystery on your hands.|It’s hard because some hospitals are super toxic despite the facade of an amazing culture. Some of them truly have people that don’t bring toxicity to the table. A lot of the anti veg feelings out there that aren’t about the open concept are about the cult vibes. You’re absolutely joining a cult when you join veg. You just have to figure out how much of that aspect you’re going to participate in. 

It’s only emergency so our job in a case that belongs in specialty is to stabilize and facilitate a transfer. Sometimes that gets sticky because the family doesn’t want to go to specialty, or (rarely) the doctor tries to handle something outside the scope of ER-only. That’s another big point of contention out there. I’ve personally begged cases that needed internal med to go to specialty a mile down the road and they won’t go. 

The more corporate and huge the company becomes, the more divisive it will be. You’ll hear from people in all positions how horrible it was and also how great it is. The toughest part of coming in as a new grad is you really don’t know where you’ll end up full time. So the advice to get to know the hospital is only useful up to a point.  

As someone who has watched many baby doctors grow and learn, I do think it’s something to try while you’re young. I don’t think many people start out in ER after school and stay their entire careers. My body is breaking down after less than 4 years as a nurse (I started in my 40s lol). So if you have the itch to do ER, do it with veg or someone else while your body can still stay up all night! 

Oh and veg doesn’t have non competes so you can jump ship without that looming over you if it turns out to be not a good fit.

As someone who has watched many baby doctors grow and learn, I do think it’s something to try while you’re young. I don’t think many people start out in ER after school and stay their entire careers. My body is breaking down after less than 4 years as a nurse (I started in my 40s lol). So if you have the itch to do ER, do it with veg or someone else while your body can still stay up all night! 

Oh and veg doesn’t have non competes so you can jump ship without that looming over you if it turns out to be not a good fit. 

Rambling on my day off lol sorry. There’s a lot I wish y’all knew before coming on board so I’m trying to be that person|There’s probably a lot going on in Doctorland that I don’t even know about.  There’s always a new resource popping up and that part of it is great",Other

snowkitty_,"If you're primarily looking for a job there, I'd probably visit as many clinics to make the most of it (ie. spending a week or less in each clinic vs all your time in just one). I know 1 week is really short to really get to know a clinic so you will need to make the most of your time. Ask them questions regarding employment packages, how the employees like working there, experience levels within staff, mentorship and new grad support etc (basically things you would ask in a job interview). I moved back home after vet school but didn't extern in a lot of clinics here which I regret not doing during my summer breaks as I didn't know the clinics very well when I went job hunting.|That's what I was worried about. I spoke to the owner and they said they do have a business one that covers all the DVMs but it's not written in.

Nervous_Ad2818,"You should be fine! I think medicine in general is modernizing, and tattoos aren’t as taboo as they used to be.

I did work in two different vet clinics in Texas, one in the city and one in the boondocks. Both Dr.’s were “old-fashioned” and required tats and “unconventional” piercings to be covered/ removed.

I feel like most of the information that’s even tested at the end of certain units isn’t even that important to know. It’s just stressful to think about how the VTNE costs almost $350 to take. I’ve tried calling multiple vet offices to volunteer because I haven’t yet reached the end of my 2nd semester to do the internship and I haven’t found one yet that will allow me to volunteer. I wish I would’ve had the option to go to school in person but there is not one school near me that offers that course. I just hope I can get through this and pass the vtne on the first try because $350 is A LOT for me.|How different is tech than veterinarian? I’m currently in vet tech school,Other

For one-off surgeries it's not a big deal but if you're doing it all day it can really start to hurt! And I do large animal necropsies in high bio containment... I refuse to struggle with the scissors in that environment.|I've been there. On my general surgery rotation I wasn't expecting that they'd want us to close the skin with interdermal pattern. After my client spay the surgeon pulled me aside and said that I had good tissue handling but was behind my classmates in terms of the suturing skills etc. I felt really bad about it but went home and did a lot of practice.

Remember that your clinicians generally want you to succeed. They're giving you this feedback so you can apply it. Practice what you can with models at home, take any opportunity you can on the rotation to do the hands-on skill. Ask the techs for tips and to help you. This will demonstrate you taking the initiative, and you will be practicing, which should help both things they're critiquing you for. If you don't have a lot of experience, of course you're not going to be perfect--you just need to practice.

Take a breath, stay calm, be patient while you're doing the skill. You got this.

Being a vet is multifactorial--you've got the knowledge portion, surgery, technical skills, examination, people skills, etc. Just because you are lagging in one doesn't mean you can't be a great vet. And honestly, once you get out in practice, a lot of the technical skills get done by technicians... when I tape a catheter you can tell it was me because the techs' always look beautiful lol.","This comment should be classified as ""Veterinarian."""

I was so shocked, and now I know it’s become a whole thing. I’ve had dogs for decades, many dogs as a breeder, and I always made sure they were trained for the vet. You don’t bring a farrier out to do your horse’s hooves without training them to stand…. I bring my own bait and we practice the table exam and raising confidence while waiting for the vet to come in. At home I practice touching them everywhere and restraining them so they are used to it and enjoy it. All of mine end up enjoying the vet visits and getting excited when they know it’s time.

teawbooks,"Thank you for laying this out so thoroughly. I left the veterinary profession after completing my internship, entirely due to my experience during that year. I even received a commendation for my performance that year, but I was miserable. I have always felt like a failure that I couldn’t keep going on to residency, but I didn’t think I could manage any more of the system.  My treatment during internship was so appalling, that I now actually feel anxious taking my own animals to a vet clinic. Trying to explain this to other people is impossible.

It seems like a lot of it comes down to how efficient you are and your comfort level with surgery. Surgery is a huge part of most people's production. 

You're going to take longer to finish your paperwork and to look things up during your first year out until you develop a large set of cases you've seen before and no longer need to look up every detail, so you may struggle to keep up with your half hour appointments. You may also be loaded with wellness appointments as you start. That's normal and will pass! But keep trucking and definitely always aim for your production.

xdg07,">Are we expected to see a traffic increase for non-whitelisted nodes in the near future?

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).|>Why should I invest in MYST now? What are your plans to drive value to the token?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token. As mentioned above, both our dVPN consumer and B2B client base is growing, meaning that network traffic is increasing as well.  
Additionally, you can stake your MYST token into Delegation pool https://app.iq.space/ (powered by our partners IQ protocol) and earn rewards.|>Is there a specific reason that Mysterium VPN is not listed on the Apple store?

Yes, the main issue was technical iOS requirements for the runtime. Due to decentralised P2P network specifics, our VPN apps has to include the whole node code which makes runtime bigger than allowed. However, the good news is that we already found a solution and iOS app is in our short term plans. We've already started working on the designs and hopefully will be able to release it during this year.|>How do you protect your users from bad actors?

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x.

In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).|>Why should I invest in MYST now?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens.

You Could also ask if your hospital has a rescue fund for people who can’t afford treatment and make a donation to that, or donate to a local rescue they work with in your kitty’s name.|BluePearl has the EmERge program that, as far as I know, doesn’t have a set start date. However, from what I’ve seen working in a BP in the NYC market, they don’t provide the mentorship they promise. If you do that route, I would ask to speak to people who’ve done the entire program at the hospital you are thinking of enrolling.

Sorry, I just looked into it, and they have a July/January start time as well, with the first four weeks having to be done in Tampa|Turn off the iso and the oxygen for flipping otherwise you’re just blowing the iso in the tubes into the room and when your patient is hooked back up they have a lower concentration of iso in the breathing system.|I don’t think any practice would make an estimate for a sick animal that they haven’t seen, because they can’t know what, exactly, is going on or if the treatment plan your vet proposed is the one they would follow. They also would t know what diagnostics have already been run, and diagnostics are a huge portion of any sick pet invoice. 

Giving a ballpark for a routine spay/neuter isn’t that uncommon because those are typically healthy pets and very straightforward procedures.|It isn’t uncommon for practices to not want to give out ballpark figures for their procedures, but I feel like that is changing with time. Many will have a list of typical spay/neuter prices at reception so the receptionists don’t even have to ask anyone. 

I don’t see why invoices should be consistently over estimates by such a large margin in a GP practice. The only thing I can think of where invoices could run high with some regularity would be dental procedures, but even those should have a wide range on the estimate because we know that we don’t have a complete idea of what needs to be done until the animal is anesthetized and the rads are done, and the invoice should still fall within the higher end of the range. 

When these bills come in over the estimate, does the practice owner discuss this with the client before they come in to pay, or, even better, before the extra charges are incurred? They should definitely not be leaving this conversation for receptionists or technicians to have with clients. 

If your hours are being cut because the practice is slow, I would look for another job. There is typically a predictable mild slow down in January and February, but most practices are able to combat this with Dental month promotions, and I’ve never worked anywhere that cuts employee hours for those months. Since Covid, I don’t even know if that seasonal slowdown is really applicable anymore. Most of the vets in my area are still having full schedules. I would take the combination of shady invoicing and cutting hours as red flags.|If you’re mostly doing relief work, do you actually need a DEA number?|I hope the company/companies that you are working for are covering the costs!|You can summarize a lot of of messages by just listing the questions they have, with a little bit of background or a sentence about why they are asking a specific question. The only time I leave a longer message or comm log is when clients are angry, unreasonable, or a mistake has been made that needs correcting, where I really need to document what, exactly, was said. Otherwise, my message would probably have been “o has questions about seizures and plan going forward/meds/what to look for.”  Then maybe a line about why they are calling, like “has family member with seizure disorder and wants to discuss further diagnostics” to let the person calling them back know that there is a specific reason or concern prompting the message, and prepare them to explain the differences between human medicine and veterinary medicine.|It’s squandered time and money, but if the only thing holding you back from a tech degree is an externship or a single class, you might as well do it, though your raise will likely not cover the cost of the extra class you took.|I would call Avimark.|For an assistant position I would just apply and get trained on the job. Important things to remember are to always provide water to a patient unless specifically told not to, always double leash dogs on a slip lead when walking them (most dogs can slip out of a collar and even a harness if they are trying to back away), always write down all urinations/defecations a pet has done in hospital, and never ever ever do anything that you aren’t comfortable with or haven’t been trained to do. An assistant should be doing things like restraining (when appropriately trained), cleaning the hospital, cleaning cages, and walking dogs. You can also directly help a technician or a doctor do things like get blood, place IV catheters, or take x rays, but these are not your responsibility on your own. 

Also, when making up meds, double check labels on the bottle and the label in your hand twice.

If you want to do more, a nice fruit basket is extremely considerate.|I would just look for a new job. You aren’t going to fix it.  When you leave, an email to regional management delineating what’s been going on and why you’re leaving might be effective. 

If everything else is fine and it really is just these two people, I would contact HR and regional management, *especially* if you are witnessing bullying and not the one actually being bullied. I got much not interest and a lot less gas lighting when I reached out with concerns over how another person was treated than I did with concerns about how I was being treated or how my department was being run.

Also, why are students taking out the garbage? You are there to learn, not do chores. I have never asked a student to take out the garbage.

srosem343,"for anyone that did not pass, you will still be a wonderful doctor. Take a break from this emotional week, and start fresh next week. I know many great vets who are so intelligent and kind -- and they failed once or twice. It does not mean shit, and you CAN do it again. Everyone is rooting for it!! Friendly reminder to be kind to everyone this next week, I imagine it would feel pretty crummy to watch everyone celebrate, but don't let it break you. It will be okay!! No one can be YOU, and thats why we need you in the profession. Give yourself some grace, no one here is a failure <3|It’s funny because I know that I would never judge anyone for failing— this test is absolutely not indicative of your abilities and intelligence as a doctor— yet I know that I will feel shame and disappointment, and I’m dreading the part when people ask if I passed. I can’t fake it. But the test was long. I felt ready as ever walking in, and was so numb when I walked out. Took me like a full week to process it and then I went, “oh my GOD I think I failed!”

I’m crossing my fingers and toes for everyone this week. We can do this! And we can do it again if we must 🤍|Nothin like a little extra stress from the ICVA faking us out on a super fun day (I have stress colitis)|Me too I was in rounds on my clinical rotation and was waiting for it to be over— went to check and I get the no documents available message! I should’ve just been a big girl and clicked the pdf when i had the chance. This is torture!! 😭|some of my class can see theirs, but i can't see mine and neither can a few others. I'm not sure if its related to whether the result is pass or fail....hope not|Just got mine too|imo that would be cruel and unusual punishment|i think they can still see it|no idea, they haven't said|where? i dont see it|I’m also waiting 😫 some days i feel like “I kicked ass I DESERVE to pass” and then other days I’m like “you left seven questions open on section two bc you didn’t time manage so that’s probably the 7 questions you needed to pass”. It’s so hard. Plus it’s clinical year now and the minute we get that email everyone will be talking about it… I’m not sure my poker face is too good. Screw the shame and guilt. Who CARES if you fail, we will get up and do it again and we will learn something that may save a life one day. Happens for a reason. But it in no way reflects how amazing we’ve all done to have gotten this far, and (I have to remind myself too) a fail does NOT mean you will be any less worthy to work with animals and love what you do. 

Soooo long story short I’m panicking and feeling nauseous with all of you every time my email gives me a notification! Good luck to you all, and no matter what happens- WE WILL ALL BE GREAT VETERINARIANS! 🤍",Veterinarian
Content-Fact-1885,"Wow, their auto email reply says staff is traveling to the ICVA board meeting Jan 16-21 and has limited access to emails….. why do we pay almost a grand to take this test if they can’t even give score reports to the right test taker?",Other

captSNAX,"For what it’s worth, I’ve had 13 years of experience with Banfield from the other side of the counter and their care and service has had a noticeable decline over the last few years. Enough so that we only took our dog there for routine bloodwork and vaccines because they were included in a care plan that couldn’t be canceled. The last surgery experience was a total nightmare that started with them not having the sedative to put her under on the date of surgery and ended with a tech bringing my 13 yo dog out while still POURING blood from the incision sites and sutures already coming untied. This required no less than 6 follow-ups for post-op care.  My wife was a vet tech for years and I am in biology research, so we kind of knew what red flags to look for. We notice a lot that were similar to what you are describing. That being said, I understand your position. I’m not sure how your field looks at previous practice reputation, but if that is a factor, then I wouldn’t want my name attached to that company. Sterility issues are a big deal and an indicator of attention to detail. Personally, I would hold out for VCA (have had some positive experiences with them) or look for alternatives. Maybe a smaller practice in your area. But I understand the need to acquire experience, so if you do go with Banfield I would keep expectations low and keep an eye out for better opportunities. Best of luck!",Other

dmzon,"The ASPCA has great videos. https://www.aspcapro.org/resource/spayneuter-surgery-female-dogs|1. Regarding exercise, try to make it work with your time constraint. If you can commit one hour, wonderful. If you can only commit 10 minutes each day, that’s better than nothing. I started doing yoga/stretching everyday after work for 10 minutes and have gradually increased it to 30 minutes. I will adjust the time as necessary depending on how the day went. You make exercising work for you. Exercising is suppose to be beneficially, not stressful. 
2. Meal prepping. You can either spend your days off planning what you would like to cook and use that as leftovers or… you can plan the meals you want to cook, chop the ingredients and store them in the fridge and make fresh meals throughout the week. For example, most, if not all, of my meals have onions. So I will chop onions every Sunday and store it and just use however much I need to cook for each meal.",Other

xjestersdeadx,"Just to update. This was ""solved"" by reinstalling MacOs, then using a time machine backup from Feb 6 before I had installed Homebrew! I tried to copy what directories I could think of before that in terms of film projects and photos since I do a lot of editing. About 28 hours later, boom- both work again. I can turn one off, then turn the other on, and vice versa. SOMETHING I did obviously got in the way of that. The only thing I think to do is now I am back to not having Homebrew on my system. I really, really, really.... (LOL) don't want to go through that ordeal again, but if I make any other major changes I will try both VPNS each time so I can note here and warn people. As of now, it looks like something that happened with Homebrew messed up maybe a path the VPN's are looking for? I just don't know. I am already considering getting a mac mini so what I might do is try everything there, put home-brew on it, and see if that was the problem. I'm just not enough of a coder to figure out what part of it got in the way. Thanks for the suggestions to those who took the time. It is VERY much appreciated. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11g9uuf/could_connect_now_cannot_thoughts_on_what_logs_to/jc2z6wc/ | thanks for the guess! i killed the other vpn pids and in fact uninstall it. Mysteriumvpn won't connect. If I do a complete re-boot, it will connect. If I turn it off, turn on other vpn, then turn off other vpn, and try to go back to Mysterium, it doesn't connect all over again. Reboot, Mysterium first- connects. Turn it off. Use the other one, and then turn off the other one and back to Mysterium, connect times out. 

It is just frustrating as it was allowing me to switch back and forth for several weeks, then obviously I did something that isn't allowing that to happen. That's why I was wondering if I did something with Homebrew when I installed it. It had me update my default path. If I don't figure it out, I guess I will go through the several hours long process of installing everything brand new. Bummer! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11g9uuf/could_connect_now_cannot_thoughts_on_what_logs_to/jbhp90z/ | I believe what peter-soviet may have been helpfully trying to tell you, is to turn off the firewall FOR THE MOMENT, and see what happens.

It’s random which one you get ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1660jny/mysterium_lyin_abt_their_vpn_services/jyhlgzh/ | Uptime! All about uptime! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/160jii1/first_11_days_profits/jz29hab/ | VPS get half the rate residential IP’s get, I’ve got a few nodes on spare VPS’ and a couple on residential. Residential wins hands down. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/160jii1/first_11_days_profits/jz29fpg/ | Of course they can log IP addresses as it isn’t exactly difficult but there is one major caveat, that is that ISP’s are issuing CGNAT IP addresses more and more. a CGNAT IP can handle up to around 128 users, if they blocked that IP they could be potentially cutting off numerous paying customers who have done nothing wrong. There’s no real way to tell which is CGNAT and which isn’t unless of course you’re the person using it (your wan IP wouldn’t match your outside IP). They definitely wouldn’t implement this to hinder paying customers. Hope this clears that up. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15zwmih/steaming_services_blocking_ip_addresses/jxlblda/ | You can already do this? Port forward 4449 and then login using this IP

nod.eip.her.e:4449/#/dashboard ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jx8pap7/ | With how Myst works that’s not really possible. Ie nodes can only be connected to on the local network, or via external port forwarded IP.  You could set up a service like “NOIP” (dynamic DNS) that way even if the IP changes you can still access it. Ie instead of 192.***.***.** it would be my nose name.noip.net etc.  that way you can continue access to the nodes. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxdtdtg/ | Those payment options are for Mysterium
Dark. You can only subscribe on the App Store apps using normal currency. It also has less features. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15urgaf/how_to_top_up_my_mysteriumvpn_using_myst_or_other/jwrkm6a/ | No but if your using mysterium dark you can by the tokens from metamask or some other exchange for cheaper. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15lm2oy/mysterium_promo_code/jvf2232/ | How? 😂😂 I have a gig up and down, fixed IP and nowhere near that. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/14wzgcn/how_can_i_maximise_my_earnings/jsd28rz/ | I run a couple nodes, never have any DDOS issues. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/13n27de/how_can_i_protect_myself_from_having_ddos_attacks/jlzhdj6/ | How much are you earning? I earn around 55-60 Myst per month with a 25mb upload ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/13iwovz/1_question_about_increasing_myst_earnings_and_a/jkm20rx/ | If you allow public then yes anyone can use your ip for nefarious means, it doesn’t mean they will, there’s cheaper and easier options like “TOR” main reasons public would use Myst is for like streaming etc. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/13iiulx/are_nodes_safe/jkm27tx/",Other

You will also need to be able to do basic drug calculations.    Undergraduate math courses are more advanced than anything you will have to do in vet school, but you are expected to have retained a baseline knowledge of concepts. Your college grades will help determine if you're a candidate for vet school application.

I try to keep my bigger meal at lunch time and eat a smaller meal at dinner before bed, especially as I'm often eating dinner quite late. I keep tea bags at work to have a low cal beverage in the afternoons.

I find it hard to have a regular weekly exercise schedule, but I have some drop-in exercise classes that I try to attend.

Just wanted to add another perspective based on one thing you mentioned. At the practice I work at, it’s standard procedure to handle all paperwork and financial matters PRIOR to euthanasia. I’ve never had one single client raise an eyebrow about jt. Our CSRs always get that part out of the way first, so the owner can focus on their pet and not have to worry about anything else. No one wants to stop in the lobby to pay their bill after they’ve cried their eyes out and lost their pet.

Use glassdoor?|Brah, I graduated from school in 2016, Rossie who had to do clinics at Purdue and that place lives rent free in my mind unfortunately.  I rarely think about it now but I had to have a full blown mental breakdown to change my attitude into something they wanted.  It worked, I became bitter, mean, and short with everyone... which they translated into confident, leadership, and gets the work done.  I still have my reviews from there, scanned, and in a folder deep in my DVM folder.  I really should delete them.  

Anyways, I feel you. I hear you.  Just do what they want and if you get a passing grade, move on and don't read the reviews imo.  When you get out, no one cares what you do as long as it's not gross negligence.  Not saying you should practice bad medicine but the pressure will be relieved eventually.|It's been 7 years so maybe things have changed?  Just keep your head down, prepare like crazy, and you'll likely be okay.  I mean, it's going to be hell.  But it's only 1 year, then you're free forever.|You know, I think if I could've given myself some advice prior to arriving, I would've just warned myself that I was going to be tossed to the wolves.  I showed up in the middle of the clinical year for the Purdue students and although they say they give the necessary consideration for new Rossies... they did not.  I was put in Orthopedics and basically told to setup an ICU sheet for my patient.  I didn't even know where the ICU was.  The other students tried to help me but it was clear the clinician felt I was getting too much help.  So I guess what I'd say is try and request to be put on a simpler rotation like radiology or something and if that doesn't work, research the fuck about whatever case you take, act confident, and hope you look good.|Ya, I really struggled there.  They actually ordered me into therapy and I remember walking in and sitting down.  The therapist asked me if I was having a problem with a specific person.

I'm being pushed around as well and it's like everything is so positive.  We get stuck in our places so there's definitely better things out there.  Fuck Banfield.  Fuck the corps.|I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.  

This is a rant because I'm so burned out.  But again, scared to make a move and miserable at my place.|That was a definite rant.  I just needed to write it.  And yes, I'm in the process of looking again jobs right now.  I'll be sad to leave some folks but it's time.|My friend got into VEG and really liked it and tried to convince me to join.  I went through several interviews and it seemed alright.  I had done relief veterinary shifts on holidays and randomly on weekends so I wasn't really new to the game.  After being told I had the job and I would start with them in a new clinic in NC, they suddenly shifted and told me they had to fire two doctors for not practicing medicine their way and I (and anyone else who wasn't a full time ER doc) was going to have to go through a training program that requires 6 months minimum.  So I decided to talk to the ""training program administrator"" and I could tell the interview was soured in the first 5 minutes.  She didn't like my ""not 100% dedicated to VEG attitude and staying every night forever concerns"".  My friend had told me I would work some nights which was fine but I could also do day shifts pretty quickly.  

So after 1 working interview, a flight to observe a clinic in GA, and 3 phone calls, I was suddenly out.  Really still makes me mad because I was making huge changes to my life to move to VEG.  

Yes, they want the veterinarian to answer every phone call.  They never say ""no"" but they will drain the lifeblood of a client before they start doing free services and then kick them to the regular DVM with no money, and you have to drink the kool-aid.  I predict it will be as wonderful as Banfield - great place for money but you should be prepared to be uncomfortable.|I took the NAVLE THREE TIMES.  I nearly passed the first time and I barely studied.  Then I studied really hard and failed it by an even bigger margin.  Then I requested time accommodation because I have ADHD and I passed without a problem.

I struggled with the intense time management and I needed a little help with that.  No one knows this unless I tell them.  No one cares.  You pass the test, you're a veterinarian.  I am built a little differently than other vets and honestly, I think it's to my advantage.  Don't beat yourself up, keep studying, and I'm sure you'll be fine.|I don't think there's much I can add but I'd tell you to read up on boundaries.  Boundaries for me at my clinic is that I'm not going to run around with my head chopped off or stay late.  If I can't find a tech, that's a big shame because I guess it's time to chill until someone arrives.  The owner of my clinic and one of the techs who recently graduated both sit by the rooms waiting to take the next one that arrives and I chill in the office.  I'm not jumping through hoops to get into rooms (I'm salary only) and so I know they boast they do more but really it does not matter.  I've worked emergency and I know I can go fast so they're basically wasting money by not using my skills appropriately.  When I started at my clinic, they had a habit of also running bloodwork after anesthesia or gassing my cats down.  I had to learn to put my foot down and demand that the pets get propofol instead of gas, we wait for the bloodwork, and if I'm not comfortable with the procedures, I can do rooms instead.  A lot of these owners will pressure you to conform because that means it's simple for them.  But you need to force them to conform to the practices you learned in school or like everyone else says, just leave and find a place that will welcome you.  There are SOOOO many places that'd die for a veterinarian that's motivated to do better.|Chat or did the mentor watch?  I kept getting scrotal hematomas until a senior veterinarian watched me and corrected me on one part.  Then they decreased drastically.|Find a therapist early.

Edit: What do you wish someone told you before you went to vet school?
-> I think my mentor said it best.  ""It was the best time in his life and he never wants to do it again"".  It's so intense and fulfilling and difficult that life seems to lack some flavor once you graduate.

What are opportunities you’re glad you took advantage of?
-> I tried shelter work, emergency work, shot clinics, etc.  If they'd have me, I'd try my hand.  It's made me much more rounded and experienced even if I think clinic work is all I want to do.

What opportunities to you wish you had taken advantage of?
-> Don't hesitate to ask for more.  Don't feel bad for others not getting as much as you because you deserve it.|I started doing relief work in an emergency clinic near me after I felt a bit more settled on my feet.  It was still difficult and I never really fit into their culture of taking all the money they can and letting animals die if they didn't have the funds.|As a doctor, I often have no idea where someone is skill level wise.  Some folks are good as soon as they hit the floor, others need time.  I'd say to be direct and upfront - ""I have NOT been taught anything like this before and need assistance at least on the first time.""

The only thing I would caution you is to MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN.  I can't tell you how many times I've taught the system to someone and then a few days later I hear ""I was never taught this"".  When I hear that, I just assume they're lazy, lying, or weren't listening.  Either record on your phone the process and write it down later, or write it down right there.  Then move forward.|Write individual cards maybe to the doctor and to the staff?  Like what you appreciate from each group?  And some unique treats would be neat.  Tons of store bought cookies are brought in and they're nice but when someone brings in a really tasty and interesting cookie, it goes quickly.  

I had a lady bring her cat to me because of chronic pain and I told her I could be bribed with cupcakes since she said the bill was going to be hard to take care of.  She brought the cupcakes and that was nice but she never updated me after the procedure.  I had to reach out to her and then I found out that I made a world of difference to her pet.  Honestly when I don't hear back from people, I assume 60% of the time it worked out and 40% they're totally dead.  But I am kinda negative haha|I failed it twice and still passed.  You know how many people care or ask?  0|Best not to think about it.  It's done with for now.  Who knows what will happen :)|First time I barely had time to study and I got right below passing.  
Second time I studied really hard and yes, got 100% on vet prep/zuku and I failed it again by even more than the first time.
Third time I was out of vet school and wayyyyy more relaxed.  The timing was my problem so I passed after I realized that.  Plus fuck the pig skin sections.|Are you a veterinarian? If someone told me my salary was going to be cut, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  Veterinarians are incredibly rare right now and there are plenty of private clinics that would go nuts for you as long as you're not asking for the world.  Don't be surprised if they do let you go as the corporations are pretty short sighted and 100% focused on money.|When we recieved our feedback at Purdue, even the brightest students had to get drunk before reading the reviews.  Vets are great at helping animals but they suck at teaching and providing feedback.

Just jump through their hoops and get through the program.  My friend was a brilliant surgeon and overall everyone loves her.  After school we chatted 3 years later and she basically stopped doing any and all surgery because of anxiety.  Me? I got dismal heartbreaking feedback and I do surgeries the college near me have refused because of difficulty.

Just finish up and after about 3-6 years you'll know where you stand.  It's a tough and very long road.|1. Not sure what you're asking on the first question.
2. Everyone has their opinion on vet med.  It's really really hard and anyone that goes into the field thinking they're working on puppies is delusional.  Which unfortunately is the case because there are folks that get into the field and then are surprised that it's hard as hell and they can't leave because they have to pay off the loans.  Go work or volunteer at a vet clinic or two and make your own opinion.  I personally find being a veterinarian very liberating because I can move anywhere, I'm wanted, and I can do good for others.  But I also find it exhausting, mentally depressing, and you're going to need a therapist for sure.
3. You can pay them off with Income Based Repayment.  You will have to have a strategy to pay them off but think of it like getting a mortgage without a house.  
4. Depends on the school.  A lot of them teach everything because the NAVLE tests you on all the animals BUT you can select extra courses in your field of interest.|Ross School of Veterinary Medicine is English based and is technically abroad.|Most schools have a list of pre-requistes they require.  They like to see people are moving towards a degree but they will accept folks before they finish a bachelors if they're impressive enough.  Yes, if the trade school doesn't have the required credits, it's not helping.  Find out if the trade school has all the required courses and that they're considered acceptable by the majority of schools.|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.

This is a rant because I'm so burned out.  But again, scared to make a move and miserable at my place.|That was a definite rant.  I just needed to write it.  And yes, I'm in the process of looking again jobs right now.  I'll be sad to leave some folks but it's time.|My friend got into VEG and really liked it and tried to convince me to join.  I went through several interviews and it seemed alright.  I had done relief veterinary shifts on holidays and randomly on weekends so I wasn't really new to the game.  After being told I had the job and I would start with them in a new clinic in NC, they suddenly shifted and told me they had to fire two doctors for not practicing medicine their way and I (and anyone else who wasn't a full time ER doc) was going to have to go through a training program that requires 6 months minimum.  So I decided to talk to the ""training program administrator"" and I could tell the interview was soured in the first 5 minutes.  She didn't like my ""not 100% dedicated to VEG attitude and staying every night forever concerns"".  My friend had told me I would work some nights which was fine but I could also do day shifts pretty quickly.  

So after 1 working interview, a flight to observe a clinic in GA, and 3 phone calls, I was suddenly out.  Really still makes me mad because I was making huge changes to my life to move to VEG.  

Yes, they want the veterinarian to answer every phone call.  They never say ""no"" but they will drain the lifeblood of a client before they start doing free services and then kick them to the regular DVM with no money, and you have to drink the kool-aid.  I predict it will be as wonderful as Banfield - great place for money but you should be prepared to be uncomfortable.|I took the NAVLE THREE TIMES.  I nearly passed the first time and I barely studied.  Then I studied really hard and failed it by an even bigger margin.  Then I requested time accommodation because I have ADHD and I passed without a problem.

I struggled with the intense time management and I needed a little help with that.  No one knows this unless I tell them.  No one cares.  You pass the test, you're a veterinarian.  I am built a little differently than other vets and honestly, I think it's to my advantage.  Don't beat yourself up, keep studying, and I'm sure you'll be fine.|I don't think there's much I can add but I'd tell you to read up on boundaries.  Boundaries for me at my clinic is that I'm not going to run around with my head chopped off or stay late.  If I can't find a tech, that's a big shame because I guess it's time to chill until someone arrives.  The owner of my clinic and one of the techs who recently graduated both sit by the rooms waiting to take the next one that arrives and I chill in the office.  I'm not jumping through hoops to get into rooms (I'm salary only) and so I know they boast they do more but really it does not matter.  I've worked emergency and I know I can go fast so they're basically wasting money by not using my skills appropriately.  When I started at my clinic, they had a habit of also running bloodwork after anesthesia or gassing my cats down.  I had to learn to put my foot down and demand that the pets get propofol instead of gas, we wait for the bloodwork, and if I'm not comfortable with the procedures, I can do rooms instead.  A lot of these owners will pressure you to conform because that means it's simple for them.  But you need to force them to conform to the practices you learned in school or like everyone else says, just leave and find a place that will welcome you.  There are SOOOO many places that'd die for a veterinarian that's motivated to do better.|Chat or did the mentor watch?  I kept getting scrotal hematomas until a senior veterinarian watched me and corrected me on one part.  Then they decreased drastically.|Find a therapist early.

Edit: What do you wish someone told you before you went to vet school?
-> I think my mentor said it best.  ""It was the best time in his life and he never wants to do it again"".  It's so intense and fulfilling and difficult that life seems to lack some flavor once you graduate.

What are opportunities you’re glad you took advantage of?
-> I tried shelter work, emergency work, shot clinics, etc.  If they'd have me, I'd try my hand.  It's made me much more rounded and experienced even if I think clinic work is all I want to do.

What opportunities to you wish you had taken advantage of?
-> Don't hesitate to ask for more.  Don't feel bad for others not getting as much as you because you deserve it.|I started doing relief work in an emergency clinic near me after I felt a bit more settled on my feet.  It was still difficult and I never really fit into their culture of taking all the money they can and letting animals die if they didn't have the funds.|As a doctor, I often have no idea where someone is skill level wise.  Some folks are good as soon as they hit the floor, others need time.  I'd say to be direct and upfront - ""I have NOT been taught anything like this before and need assistance at least on the first time.""

The only thing I would caution you is to MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN.  I can't tell you how many times I've taught the system to someone and then a few days later I hear ""I was never taught this"".  When I hear that, I just assume they're lazy, lying, or weren't listening.  Either record on your phone the process and write it down later, or write it down right there.  Then move forward.|Write individual cards maybe to the doctor and to the staff?  Like what you appreciate from each group?  And some unique treats would be neat.  Tons of store bought cookies are brought in and they're nice but when someone brings in a really tasty and interesting cookie, it goes quickly.  

I had a lady bring her cat to me because of chronic pain and I told her I could be bribed with cupcakes since she said the bill was going to be hard to take care of.  She brought the cupcakes and that was nice but she never updated me after the procedure.  I had to reach out to her and then I found out that I made a world of difference to her pet.  Honestly when I don't hear back from people, I assume 60% of the time it worked out and 40% they're totally dead.  But I am kinda negative haha|I failed it twice and still passed.  You know how many people care or ask?  0|Best not to think about it.  It's done with for now.  Who knows what will happen :)|First time I barely had time to study and I got right below passing.  
Second time I studied really hard and yes, got 100% on vet prep/zuku and I failed it again by even more than the first time.
Third time I was out of vet school and wayyyyy more relaxed.  The timing was my problem so I passed after I realized that.  Plus fuck the pig skin sections.|Are you a veterinarian? If someone told me my salary was going to be cut, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  Veterinarians are incredibly rare right now and there are plenty of private clinics that would go nuts for you as long as you're not asking for the world.  Don't be surprised if they do let you go as the corporations are pretty short sighted and 100% focused on money.|When we recieved our feedback at Purdue, even the brightest students had to get drunk before reading the reviews.  Vets are great at helping animals but they suck at teaching and providing feedback.

Just jump through their hoops and get through the program.  My friend was a brilliant surgeon and overall everyone loves her.  After school we chatted 3 years later and she basically stopped doing any and all surgery because of anxiety.  Me? I got dismal heartbreaking feedback and I do surgeries the college near me have refused because of difficulty.

Just finish up and after about 3-6 years you'll know where you stand.  It's a tough and very long road.|1. Not sure what you're asking on the first question.
2. Everyone has their opinion on vet med.  It's really really hard and anyone that goes into the field thinking they're working on puppies is delusional.  Which unfortunately is the case because there are folks that get into the field and then are surprised that it's hard as hell and they can't leave because they have to pay off the loans.  Go work or volunteer at a vet clinic or two and make your own opinion.  I personally find being a veterinarian very liberating because I can move anywhere, I'm wanted, and I can do good for others.  But I also find it exhausting, mentally depressing, and you're going to need a therapist for sure.
3. You can pay them off with Income Based Repayment.  You will have to have a strategy to pay them off but think of it like getting a mortgage without a house.  
4. Depends on the school.  A lot of them teach everything because the NAVLE tests you on all the animals BUT you can select extra courses in your field of interest.|Ross School of Veterinary Medicine is English based and is technically abroad.|Most schools have a list of pre-requistes they require.  They like to see people are moving towards a degree but they will accept folks before they finish a bachelors if they're impressive enough.  Yes, if the trade school doesn't have the required credits, it's not helping.  Find out if the trade school has all the required courses and that they're considered acceptable by the majority of schools.|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.  It's fine if they want to be disrespectful quietly until I can gain their confidence but I 100% do not tolerate outright disrespect.  

They are not only not trusting you, they're trying to see where your boundaries are.  You need to be strong and explain that how you want to be referred to.  

Also, it sounds like they're kinda being dicks.  This is why most new doctors leave their first clinic within 1-2 years.|Every vet clinic is incredibly different.  The owner sets the tone for the place and everyone kinda follows suit.  If the techs feel comfortable being this rude, don't plan to stay.  I'd personally start looking for a different clinic, even if it's a bit further away, and just not mention this one.  Then when you're leaving, explain why you're leaving.  You can try to work it out but it sounds like it's not worth the effort.  There are better places out there.|Ill toss my hat in.  I've made some depressing posts before but I will say this, I'd rather be a vet than not a vet.  If I could redo things, I might have chosen ophthalmology or something a little simpler.  My ophthalmologist works 9-5pm, leaves on time, and makes 2x as much as I do.  However I also get to do cool ass surgeries, save people's pets who can be their entire world, and I have a lot of flexibility in where I work and how I want to work.  Veterinary medicine is incredibly hard though so be prepared for that.  I always point out to my brothers who are computer programmers that they don't have a website dedicated to preventing suicide of computer engineers.  :\|I'm a general practitioner so I'm not sure, sorry...|With the inability to find new grads, they're likely giving you a high offer and this is pretty good - better than my current job and I've been out for 7 years.  

I think the only things I would worry about is how hard the 4 days would be, is it a no compete, and what the mentorship would really look like?

I think the prevailing belief is if someone is asking for the moon, they better perform well.  However this is a corporation - so if you're not doing well, I'm sure they won't be afraid to let you go.

Do some research into other practices in the area?   Use glassdoor?|Brah, I graduated from school in 2016, Rossie who had to do clinics at Purdue and that place lives rent free in my mind unfortunately.  I rarely think about it now but I had to have a full blown mental breakdown to change my attitude into something they wanted.  It worked, I became bitter, mean, and short with everyone... which they translated into confident, leadership, and gets the work done.  I still have my reviews from there, scanned, and in a folder deep in my DVM folder.  I really should delete them.  

Anyways, I feel you. I hear you.  Just do what they want and if you get a passing grade, move on and don't read the reviews imo.  When you get out, no one cares what you do as long as it's not gross negligence.  Not saying you should practice bad medicine but the pressure will be relieved eventually.|It's been 7 years so maybe things have changed?  Just keep your head down, prepare like crazy, and you'll likely be okay.  I mean, it's going to be hell.  But it's only 1 year, then you're free forever.|You know, I think if I could've given myself some advice prior to arriving, I would've just warned myself that I was going to be tossed to the wolves.  I showed up in the middle of the clinical year for the Purdue students and although they say they give the necessary consideration for new Rossies... they did not.  I was put in Orthopedics and basically told to setup an ICU sheet for my patient.  I didn't even know where the ICU was.  The other students tried to help me but it was clear the clinician felt I was getting too much help.  So I guess what I'd say is try and request to be put on a simpler rotation like radiology or something and if that doesn't work, research the fuck about whatever case you take, act confident, and hope you look good.|Ya, I really struggled there.  They actually ordered me into therapy and I remember walking in and sitting down.  The therapist asked me if I was having a problem with a specific person.  I just uttered the teacher's name and she was like... right... you're not the first to have an issue with him.  The guy has moved on but he was a right dick.|You're preaching to the choir.  However the idea that a student can make any major changes is highly unlikely.  So I was giving realistic advice for anyone heading to Purdue.  It's not okay but this is the world we live in.|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.

I'm being pushed around as well and it's like everything is so positive.  We get stuck in our places so there's definitely better things out there.  Fuck Banfield.  Fuck the corps.|I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.

It worked, I became bitter, mean, and short with everyone... which they translated into confident, leadership, and gets the work done.  I still have my reviews from there, scanned, and in a folder deep in my DVM folder.  I really should delete them.  

Anyways, I feel you. I hear you.  Just do what they want and if you get a passing grade, move on and don't read the reviews imo.  When you get out, no one cares what you do as long as it's not gross negligence.  Not saying you should practice bad medicine but the pressure will be relieved eventually.|It's been 7 years so maybe things have changed?  Just keep your head down, prepare like crazy, and you'll likely be okay.  I mean, it's going to be hell.  But it's only 1 year, then you're free forever.|You know, I think if I could've given myself some advice prior to arriving, I would've just warned myself that I was going to be tossed to the wolves.  I showed up in the middle of the clinical year for the Purdue students and although they say they give the necessary consideration for new Rossies... they did not.  I was put in Orthopedics and basically told to setup an ICU sheet for my patient.  I didn't even know where the ICU was.  The other students tried to help me but it was clear the clinician felt I was getting too much help.  So I guess what I'd say is try and request to be put on a simpler rotation like radiology or something and if that doesn't work, research the fuck about whatever case you take, act confident, and hope you look good.|Ya, I really struggled there.  They actually ordered me into therapy and I remember walking in and sitting down.  The therapist asked me if I was having a problem with a specific person.  I just uttered the teacher's name and she was like... right... you're not the first to have an issue with him.  The guy has moved on but he was a right dick.|You're preaching to the choir.  However the idea that a student can make any major changes is highly unlikely.  So I was giving realistic advice for anyone heading to Purdue.  It's not okay but this is the world we live in.|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.  It's fine if they want to be disrespectful quietly until I can gain their confidence but I 100% do not tolerate outright disrespect.  

They are not only not trusting you, they're trying to see where your boundaries are.  You need to be strong and explain that how you want to be referred to.  

Also, it sounds like they're kinda being dicks.  This is why most new doctors leave their first clinic within 1-2 years.|Every vet clinic is incredibly different.  The owner sets the tone for the place and everyone kinda follows suit.  If the techs feel comfortable being this rude, don't plan to stay.  I'd personally start looking for a different clinic, even if it's a bit further away, and just not mention this one.  Then when you're leaving, explain why you're leaving.  You can try to work it out but it sounds like it's not worth the effort.  There are better places out there.|Ill toss my hat in.  I've made some depressing posts before but I will say this, I'd rather be a vet than not a vet.  If I could redo things, I might have chosen ophthalmology or something a little simpler.  My ophthalmologist works 9-5pm, leaves on time, and makes 2x as much as I do.  However I also get to do cool ass surgeries, save people's pets who can be their entire world, and I have a lot of flexibility in where I work and how I want to work.  Veterinary medicine is incredibly hard though so be prepared for that.  I always point out to my brothers who are computer programmers that they don't have a website dedicated to preventing suicide of computer engineers.  :\|I'm a general practitioner so I'm not sure, sorry...|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.

I'm being pushed around as well and it's like everything is so positive.  We get stuck in our places so there's definitely better things out there.  Fuck Banfield.  Fuck the corps.|I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.  

This is a rant because I'm so burned out.  But again, scared to make a move and miserable at my place.|That was a definite rant.  I just needed to write it.  And yes, I'm in the process of looking again jobs right now.  I'll be sad to leave some folks but it's time.|My friend got into VEG and really liked it and tried to convince me to join.  I went through several interviews and it seemed alright.  I had done relief veterinary shifts on holidays and randomly on weekends so I wasn't really new to the game.  After being told I had the job and I would start with them in a new clinic in NC, they suddenly shifted and told me they had to fire two doctors for not practicing medicine their way and I (and anyone else who wasn't a full time ER doc) was going to have to go through a training program that requires 6 months minimum.  So I decided to talk to the ""training program administrator"" and I could tell the interview was soured in the first 5 minutes.  She didn't like my ""not 100% dedicated to VEG attitude and staying every night forever concerns"".  My friend had told me I would work some nights which was fine but I could also do day shifts pretty quickly.  

So after 1 working interview, a flight to observe a clinic in GA, and 3 phone calls, I was suddenly out.  Really still makes me mad because I was making huge changes to my life to move to VEG.  

Yes, they want the veterinarian to answer every phone call.  They never say ""no"" but they will drain the lifeblood of a client before they start doing free services and then kick them to the regular DVM with no money, and you have to drink the kool-aid.  I predict it will be as wonderful as Banfield - great place for money but you should be prepared to be uncomfortable.|I took the NAVLE THREE TIMES.  I nearly passed the first time and I barely studied.  Then I studied really hard and failed it by an even bigger margin.  Then I requested time accommodation because I have ADHD and I passed without a problem.

I struggled with the intense time management and I needed a little help with that.  No one knows this unless I tell them.  No one cares.  You pass the test, you're a veterinarian.  I am built a little differently than other vets and honestly, I think it's to my advantage.  Don't beat yourself up, keep studying, and I'm sure you'll be fine.|I don't think there's much I can add but I'd tell you to read up on boundaries.  Boundaries for me at my clinic is that I'm not going to run around with my head chopped off or stay late.  If I can't find a tech, that's a big shame because I guess it's time to chill until someone arrives.  The owner of my clinic and one of the techs who recently graduated both sit by the rooms waiting to take the next one that arrives and I chill in the office.  I'm not jumping through hoops to get into rooms (I'm salary only) and so I know they boast they do more but really it does not matter.  I've worked emergency and I know I can go fast so they're basically wasting money by not using my skills appropriately.  When I started at my clinic, they had a habit of also running bloodwork after anesthesia or gassing my cats down.  I had to learn to put my foot down and demand that the pets get propofol instead of gas, we wait for the bloodwork, and if I'm not comfortable with the procedures, I can do rooms instead.  A lot of these owners will pressure you to conform because that means it's simple for them.  But you need to force them to conform to the practices you learned in school or like everyone else says, just leave and find a place that will welcome you.  There are SOOOO many places that'd die for a veterinarian that's motivated to do better.|Chat or did the mentor watch?  I kept getting scrotal hematomas until a senior veterinarian watched me and corrected me on one part.  Then they decreased drastically.|Find a therapist early.

Edit: What do you wish someone told you before you went to vet school?
-> I think my mentor said it best.  ""It was the best time in his life and he never wants to do it again"".  It's so intense and fulfilling and difficult that life seems to lack some flavor once you graduate.

What are opportunities you’re glad you took advantage of?
-> I tried shelter work, emergency work, shot clinics, etc.  If they'd have me, I'd try my hand.  It's made me much more rounded and experienced even if I think clinic work is all I want to do.

What opportunities to you wish you had taken advantage of?
-> Don't hesitate to ask for more.  Don't feel bad for others not getting as much as you because you deserve it.|I started doing relief work in an emergency clinic near me after I felt a bit more settled on my feet.  It was still difficult and I never really fit into their culture of taking all the money they can and letting animals die if they didn't have the funds.|As a doctor, I often have no idea where someone is skill level wise.  Some folks are good as soon as they hit the floor, others need time.  I'd say to be direct and upfront - ""I have NOT been taught anything like this before and need assistance at least on the first time.""

The only thing I would caution you is to MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN.  I can't tell you how many times I've taught the system to someone and then a few days later I hear ""I was never taught this"".  When I hear that, I just assume they're lazy, lying, or weren't listening.  Either record on your phone the process and write it down later, or write it down right there.  Then move forward.|Write individual cards maybe to the doctor and to the staff?  Like what you appreciate from each group?  And some unique treats would be neat.  Tons of store bought cookies are brought in and they're nice but when someone brings in a really tasty and interesting cookie, it goes quickly.  

I had a lady bring her cat to me because of chronic pain and I told her I could be bribed with cupcakes since she said the bill was going to be hard to take care of.  She brought the cupcakes and that was nice but she never updated me after the procedure.  I had to reach out to her and then I found out that I made a world of difference to her pet.  Honestly when I don't hear back from people, I assume 60% of the time it worked out and 40% they're totally dead.  But I am kinda negative haha|I failed it twice and still passed.  You know how many people care or ask?  0|Best not to think about it.  It's done with for now.  Who knows what will happen :)|First time I barely had time to study and I got right below passing.  
Second time I studied really hard and yes, got 100% on vet prep/zuku and I failed it again by even more than the first time.
Third time I was out of vet school and wayyyyy more relaxed.  The timing was my problem so I passed after I realized that.  Plus fuck the pig skin sections.|Are you a veterinarian? If someone told me my salary was going to be cut, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  Veterinarians are incredibly rare right now and there are plenty of private clinics that would go nuts for you as long as you're not asking for the world.  Don't be surprised if they do let you go as the corporations are pretty short sighted and 100% focused on money.|When we recieved our feedback at Purdue, even the brightest students had to get drunk before reading the reviews.  Vets are great at helping animals but they suck at teaching and providing feedback.

Just jump through their hoops and get through the program.  My friend was a brilliant surgeon and overall everyone loves her.  After school we chatted 3 years later and she basically stopped doing any and all surgery because of anxiety.  Me? I got dismal heartbreaking feedback and I do surgeries the college near me have refused because of difficulty.

Just finish up and after about 3-6 years you'll know where you stand.  It's a tough and very long road.|1. Not sure what you're asking on the first question.
2. Everyone has their opinion on vet med.  It's really really hard and anyone that goes into the field thinking they're working on puppies is delusional.  Which unfortunately is the case because there are folks that get into the field and then are surprised that it's hard as hell and they can't leave because they have to pay off the loans.  Go work or volunteer at a vet clinic or two and make your own opinion.  I personally find being a veterinarian very liberating because I can move anywhere, I'm wanted, and I can do good for others.  But I also find it exhausting, mentally depressing, and you're going to need a therapist for sure.
3. You can pay them off with Income Based Repayment.  You will have to have a strategy to pay them off but think of it like getting a mortgage without a house.  
4. Depends on the school.  A lot of them teach everything because the NAVLE tests you on all the animals BUT you can select extra courses in your field of interest.|Ross School of Veterinary Medicine is English based and is technically abroad.|Most schools have a list of pre-requistes they require.  They like to see people are moving towards a degree but they will accept folks before they finish a bachelors if they're impressive enough.  Yes, if the trade school doesn't have the required credits, it's not helping.  Find out if the trade school has all the required courses and that they're considered acceptable by the majority of schools.|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.

I think the prevailing belief is if someone is asking for the moon, they better perform well.  However this is a corporation - so if you're not doing well, I'm sure they won't be afraid to let you go.

I had to learn to put my foot down and demand that the pets get propofol instead of gas, we wait for the bloodwork, and if I'm not comfortable with the procedures, I can do rooms instead.  A lot of these owners will pressure you to conform because that means it's simple for them.  But you need to force them to conform to the practices you learned in school or like everyone else says, just leave and find a place that will welcome you.  There are SOOOO many places that'd die for a veterinarian that's motivated to do better.|Chat or did the mentor watch?  I kept getting scrotal hematomas until a senior veterinarian watched me and corrected me on one part.  Then they decreased drastically.|Find a therapist early.

Edit: What do you wish someone told you before you went to vet school?
-> I think my mentor said it best.  ""It was the best time in his life and he never wants to do it again"".  It's so intense and fulfilling and difficult that life seems to lack some flavor once you graduate.

What are opportunities you’re glad you took advantage of?
-> I tried shelter work, emergency work, shot clinics, etc.  If they'd have me, I'd try my hand.  It's made me much more rounded and experienced even if I think clinic work is all I want to do.

What opportunities to you wish you had taken advantage of?
-> Don't hesitate to ask for more.  Don't feel bad for others not getting as much as you because you deserve it.|I started doing relief work in an emergency clinic near me after I felt a bit more settled on my feet.  It was still difficult and I never really fit into their culture of taking all the money they can and letting animals die if they didn't have the funds.|As a doctor, I often have no idea where someone is skill level wise.  Some folks are good as soon as they hit the floor, others need time.  I'd say to be direct and upfront - ""I have NOT been taught anything like this before and need assistance at least on the first time.""

The only thing I would caution you is to MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN.  I can't tell you how many times I've taught the system to someone and then a few days later I hear ""I was never taught this"".  When I hear that, I just assume they're lazy, lying, or weren't listening.  Either record on your phone the process and write it down later, or write it down right there.  Then move forward.|Write individual cards maybe to the doctor and to the staff?  Like what you appreciate from each group?  And some unique treats would be neat.  Tons of store bought cookies are brought in and they're nice but when someone brings in a really tasty and interesting cookie, it goes quickly.  

I had a lady bring her cat to me because of chronic pain and I told her I could be bribed with cupcakes since she said the bill was going to be hard to take care of.  She brought the cupcakes and that was nice but she never updated me after the procedure.  I had to reach out to her and then I found out that I made a world of difference to her pet.  Honestly when I don't hear back from people, I assume 60% of the time it worked out and 40% they're totally dead.  But I am kinda negative haha|I failed it twice and still passed.  You know how many people care or ask?  0|Best not to think about it.  It's done with for now.  Who knows what will happen :)|First time I barely had time to study and I got right below passing.  
Second time I studied really hard and yes, got 100% on vet prep/zuku and I failed it again by even more than the first time.
Third time I was out of vet school and wayyyyy more relaxed.  The timing was my problem so I passed after I realized that.  Plus fuck the pig skin sections.|Are you a veterinarian? If someone told me my salary was going to be cut, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  Veterinarians are incredibly rare right now and there are plenty of private clinics that would go nuts for you as long as you're not asking for the world.  Don't be surprised if they do let you go as the corporations are pretty short sighted and 100% focused on money.|When we recieved our feedback at Purdue, even the brightest students had to get drunk before reading the reviews.  Vets are great at helping animals but they suck at teaching and providing feedback.

Just jump through their hoops and get through the program.  My friend was a brilliant surgeon and overall everyone loves her.  After school we chatted 3 years later and she basically stopped doing any and all surgery because of anxiety.  Me? I got dismal heartbreaking feedback and I do surgeries the college near me have refused because of difficulty.

Just finish up and after about 3-6 years you'll know where you stand.  It's a tough and very long road.|1. Not sure what you're asking on the first question.
2. Everyone has their opinion on vet med.  It's really really hard and anyone that goes into the field thinking they're working on puppies is delusional.  Which unfortunately is the case because there are folks that get into the field and then are surprised that it's hard as hell and they can't leave because they have to pay off the loans.  Go work or volunteer at a vet clinic or two and make your own opinion.  I personally find being a veterinarian very liberating because I can move anywhere, I'm wanted, and I can do good for others.  But I also find it exhausting, mentally depressing, and you're going to need a therapist for sure.
3. You can pay them off with Income Based Repayment.  You will have to have a strategy to pay them off but think of it like getting a mortgage without a house.  
4. Depends on the school.  A lot of them teach everything because the NAVLE tests you on all the animals BUT you can select extra courses in your field of interest.|Ross School of Veterinary Medicine is English based and is technically abroad.|Most schools have a list of pre-requistes they require.  They like to see people are moving towards a degree but they will accept folks before they finish a bachelors if they're impressive enough.  Yes, if the trade school doesn't have the required credits, it's not helping.  Find out if the trade school has all the required courses and that they're considered acceptable by the majority of schools.|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.  It's fine if they want to be disrespectful quietly until I can gain their confidence but I 100% do not tolerate outright disrespect.  

They are not only not trusting you, they're trying to see where your boundaries are.  You need to be strong and explain that how you want to be referred to.  

Also, it sounds like they're kinda being dicks.  This is why most new doctors leave their first clinic within 1-2 years.|Every vet clinic is incredibly different.  The owner sets the tone for the place and everyone kinda follows suit.  If the techs feel comfortable being this rude, don't plan to stay.  I'd personally start looking for a different clinic, even if it's a bit further away, and just not mention this one.  Then when you're leaving, explain why you're leaving.  You can try to work it out but it sounds like it's not worth the effort.  There are better places out there.|Ill toss my hat in.  I've made some depressing posts before but I will say this, I'd rather be a vet than not a vet.  If I could redo things, I might have chosen ophthalmology or something a little simpler.  My ophthalmologist works 9-5pm, leaves on time, and makes 2x as much as I do.  However I also get to do cool ass surgeries, save people's pets who can be their entire world, and I have a lot of flexibility in where I work and how I want to work.  Veterinary medicine is incredibly hard though so be prepared for that.  I always point out to my brothers who are computer programmers that they don't have a website dedicated to preventing suicide of computer engineers.  :\|I'm a general practitioner so I'm not sure, sorry...|With the inability to find new grads, they're likely giving you a high offer and this is pretty good - better than my current job and I've been out for 7 years.  

I think the only things I would worry about is how hard the 4 days would be, is it a no compete, and what the mentorship would really look like?

I think the prevailing belief is if someone is asking for the moon, they better perform well.  However this is a corporation - so if you're not doing well, I'm sure they won't be afraid to let you go.

Do some research into other practices in the area?   Use glassdoor?|Brah, I graduated from school in 2016, Rossie who had to do clinics at Purdue and that place lives rent free in my mind unfortunately.  I rarely think about it now but I had to have a full blown mental breakdown to change my attitude into something they wanted.  It worked, I became bitter, mean, and short with everyone... which they translated into confident, leadership, and gets the work done.  I still have my reviews from there, scanned, and in a folder deep in my DVM folder.  I really should delete them.  

Anyways, I feel you. I hear you.  Just do what they want and if you get a passing grade, move on and don't read the reviews imo.  When you get out, no one cares what you do as long as it's not gross negligence.  Not saying you should practice bad medicine but the pressure will be relieved eventually.|It's been 7 years so maybe things have changed?  Just keep your head down, prepare like crazy, and you'll likely be okay.  I mean, it's going to be hell.  But it's only 1 year, then you're free forever.|You know, I think if I could've given myself some advice prior to arriving, I would've just warned myself that I was going to be tossed to the wolves.  I showed up in the middle of the clinical year for the Purdue students and although they say they give the necessary consideration for new Rossies... they did not.  I was put in Orthopedics and basically told to setup an ICU sheet for my patient.  I didn't even know where the ICU was.  The other students tried to help me but it was clear the clinician felt I was getting too much help.  So I guess what I'd say is try and request to be put on a simpler rotation like radiology or something and if that doesn't work, research the fuck about whatever case you take, act confident, and hope you look good.|Ya, I really struggled there.  They actually ordered me into therapy and I remember walking in and sitting down.  The therapist asked me if I was having a problem with a specific person.

I'm being pushed around as well and it's like everything is so positive.  We get stuck in our places so there's definitely better things out there.  Fuck Banfield.  Fuck the corps.|I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.  

This is a rant because I'm so burned out.  But again, scared to make a move and miserable at my place.|That was a definite rant.  I just needed to write it.  And yes, I'm in the process of looking again jobs right now.  I'll be sad to leave some folks but it's time.|My friend got into VEG and really liked it and tried to convince me to join.  I went through several interviews and it seemed alright.  I had done relief veterinary shifts on holidays and randomly on weekends so I wasn't really new to the game.  After being told I had the job and I would start with them in a new clinic in NC, they suddenly shifted and told me they had to fire two doctors for not practicing medicine their way and I (and anyone else who wasn't a full time ER doc) was going to have to go through a training program that requires 6 months minimum.  So I decided to talk to the ""training program administrator"" and I could tell the interview was soured in the first 5 minutes.  She didn't like my ""not 100% dedicated to VEG attitude and staying every night forever concerns"".  My friend had told me I would work some nights which was fine but I could also do day shifts pretty quickly.  

So after 1 working interview, a flight to observe a clinic in GA, and 3 phone calls, I was suddenly out.  Really still makes me mad because I was making huge changes to my life to move to VEG.  

Yes, they want the veterinarian to answer every phone call.  They never say ""no"" but they will drain the lifeblood of a client before they start doing free services and then kick them to the regular DVM with no money, and you have to drink the kool-aid.  I predict it will be as wonderful as Banfield - great place for money but you should be prepared to be uncomfortable.|I took the NAVLE THREE TIMES.  I nearly passed the first time and I barely studied.  Then I studied really hard and failed it by an even bigger margin.  Then I requested time accommodation because I have ADHD and I passed without a problem.

I struggled with the intense time management and I needed a little help with that.  No one knows this unless I tell them.  No one cares.  You pass the test, you're a veterinarian.  I am built a little differently than other vets and honestly, I think it's to my advantage.  Don't beat yourself up, keep studying, and I'm sure you'll be fine.|I don't think there's much I can add but I'd tell you to read up on boundaries.  Boundaries for me at my clinic is that I'm not going to run around with my head chopped off or stay late.  If I can't find a tech, that's a big shame because I guess it's time to chill until someone arrives.  The owner of my clinic and one of the techs who recently graduated both sit by the rooms waiting to take the next one that arrives and I chill in the office.  I'm not jumping through hoops to get into rooms (I'm salary only) and so I know they boast they do more but really it does not matter.  I've worked emergency and I know I can go fast so they're basically wasting money by not using my skills appropriately.  When I started at my clinic, they had a habit of also running bloodwork after anesthesia or gassing my cats down.

My ophthalmologist works 9-5pm, leaves on time, and makes 2x as much as I do.  However I also get to do cool ass surgeries, save people's pets who can be their entire world, and I have a lot of flexibility in where I work and how I want to work.  Veterinary medicine is incredibly hard though so be prepared for that.  I always point out to my brothers who are computer programmers that they don't have a website dedicated to preventing suicide of computer engineers.  :\|I'm a general practitioner so I'm not sure, sorry...|If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.  It's fine if they want to be disrespectful quietly until I can gain their confidence but I 100% do not tolerate outright disrespect.  

They are not only not trusting you, they're trying to see where your boundaries are.  You need to be strong and explain that how you want to be referred to.  

Also, it sounds like they're kinda being dicks.  This is why most new doctors leave their first clinic within 1-2 years.|Honestly it's for the best.  I'm being pushed around as well and it's like everything is so positive.  We get stuck in our places so there's definitely better things out there.  Fuck Banfield.  Fuck the corps.|I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.  

This is a rant because I'm so burned out.  But again, scared to make a move and miserable at my place.|That was a definite rant.  I just needed to write it.  And yes, I'm in the process of looking again jobs right now.  I'll be sad to leave some folks but it's time.|My friend got into VEG and really liked it and tried to convince me to join.  I went through several interviews and it seemed alright.  I had done relief veterinary shifts on holidays and randomly on weekends so I wasn't really new to the game.  After being told I had the job and I would start with them in a new clinic in NC, they suddenly shifted and told me they had to fire two doctors for not practicing medicine their way and I (and anyone else who wasn't a full time ER doc) was going to have to go through a training program that requires 6 months minimum.  So I decided to talk to the ""training program administrator"" and I could tell the interview was soured in the first 5 minutes.  She didn't like my ""not 100% dedicated to VEG attitude and staying every night forever concerns"".  My friend had told me I would work some nights which was fine but I could also do day shifts pretty quickly.  

So after 1 working interview, a flight to observe a clinic in GA, and 3 phone calls, I was suddenly out.  Really still makes me mad because I was making huge changes to my life to move to VEG.  

Yes, they want the veterinarian to answer every phone call.  They never say ""no"" but they will drain the lifeblood of a client before they start doing free services and then kick them to the regular DVM with no money, and you have to drink the kool-aid.  I predict it will be as wonderful as Banfield - great place for money but you should be prepared to be uncomfortable.|I took the NAVLE THREE TIMES.  I nearly passed the first time and I barely studied.  Then I studied really hard and failed it by an even bigger margin.  Then I requested time accommodation because I have ADHD and I passed without a problem.

I struggled with the intense time management and I needed a little help with that.  No one knows this unless I tell them.  No one cares.  You pass the test, you're a veterinarian.  I am built a little differently than other vets and honestly, I think it's to my advantage.  Don't beat yourself up, keep studying, and I'm sure you'll be fine.|I don't think there's much I can add but I'd tell you to read up on boundaries.  Boundaries for me at my clinic is that I'm not going to run around with my head chopped off or stay late.  If I can't find a tech, that's a big shame because I guess it's time to chill until someone arrives.  The owner of my clinic and one of the techs who recently graduated both sit by the rooms waiting to take the next one that arrives and I chill in the office.  I'm not jumping through hoops to get into rooms (I'm salary only) and so I know they boast they do more but really it does not matter.  I've worked emergency and I know I can go fast so they're basically wasting money by not using my skills appropriately.  When I started at my clinic, they had a habit of also running bloodwork after anesthesia or gassing my cats down.  I had to learn to put my foot down and demand that the pets get propofol instead of gas, we wait for the bloodwork, and if I'm not comfortable with the procedures, I can do rooms instead.  A lot of these owners will pressure you to conform because that means it's simple for them.  But you need to force them to conform to the practices you learned in school or like everyone else says, just leave and find a place that will welcome you.  There are SOOOO many places that'd die for a veterinarian that's motivated to do better.|Chat or did the mentor watch?  I kept getting scrotal hematomas until a senior veterinarian watched me and corrected me on one part.  Then they decreased drastically.|Find a therapist early.

Edit: What do you wish someone told you before you went to vet school?
-> I think my mentor said it best.  ""It was the best time in his life and he never wants to do it again"".  It's so intense and fulfilling and difficult that life seems to lack some flavor once you graduate.

What are opportunities you’re glad you took advantage of?
-> I tried shelter work, emergency work, shot clinics, etc.  If they'd have me, I'd try my hand.  It's made me much more rounded and experienced even if I think clinic work is all I want to do.

What opportunities to you wish you had taken advantage of?
-> Don't hesitate to ask for more.  Don't feel bad for others not getting as much as you because you deserve it.|I started doing relief work in an emergency clinic near me after I felt a bit more settled on my feet.  It was still difficult and I never really fit into their culture of taking all the money they can and letting animals die if they didn't have the funds.|As a doctor, I often have no idea where someone is skill level wise.  Some folks are good as soon as they hit the floor, others need time.  I'd say to be direct and upfront - ""I have NOT been taught anything like this before and need assistance at least on the first time.""

The only thing I would caution you is to MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN.  I can't tell you how many times I've taught the system to someone and then a few days later I hear ""I was never taught this"".  When I hear that, I just assume they're lazy, lying, or weren't listening.  Either record on your phone the process and write it down later, or write it down right there.  Then move forward.|Write individual cards maybe to the doctor and to the staff?  Like what you appreciate from each group?  And some unique treats would be neat.  Tons of store bought cookies are brought in and they're nice but when someone brings in a really tasty and interesting cookie, it goes quickly.  

I had a lady bring her cat to me because of chronic pain and I told her I could be bribed with cupcakes since she said the bill was going to be hard to take care of.  She brought the cupcakes and that was nice but she never updated me after the procedure.  I had to reach out to her and then I found out that I made a world of difference to her pet.  Honestly when I don't hear back from people, I assume 60% of the time it worked out and 40% they're totally dead.  But I am kinda negative haha|I failed it twice and still passed.  You know how many people care or ask?  0|Best not to think about it.  It's done with for now.  Who knows what will happen :)|First time I barely had time to study and I got right below passing.  
Second time I studied really hard and yes, got 100% on vet prep/zuku and I failed it again by even more than the first time.
Third time I was out of vet school and wayyyyy more relaxed.  The timing was my problem so I passed after I realized that.  Plus fuck the pig skin sections.|Are you a veterinarian? If someone told me my salary was going to be cut, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  Veterinarians are incredibly rare right now and there are plenty of private clinics that would go nuts for you as long as you're not asking for the world.  Don't be surprised if they do let you go as the corporations are pretty short sighted and 100% focused on money.|When we recieved our feedback at Purdue, even the brightest students had to get drunk before reading the reviews.  Vets are great at helping animals but they suck at teaching and providing feedback.

Just jump through their hoops and get through the program.  My friend was a brilliant surgeon and overall everyone loves her.  After school we chatted 3 years later and she basically stopped doing any and all surgery because of anxiety.  Me? I got dismal heartbreaking feedback and I do surgeries the college near me have refused because of difficulty.

Just finish up and after about 3-6 years you'll know where you stand.  It's a tough and very long road.|1. Not sure what you're asking on the first question.
2. Everyone has their opinion on vet med.  It's really really hard and anyone that goes into the field thinking they're working on puppies is delusional.  Which unfortunately is the case because there are folks that get into the field and then are surprised that it's hard as hell and they can't leave because they have to pay off the loans.  Go work or volunteer at a vet clinic or two and make your own opinion.  I personally find being a veterinarian very liberating because I can move anywhere, I'm wanted, and I can do good for others.  But I also find it exhausting, mentally depressing, and you're going to need a therapist for sure.
3. You can pay them off with Income Based Repayment.  You will have to have a strategy to pay them off but think of it like getting a mortgage without a house.  
4. Depends on the school.  A lot of them teach everything because the NAVLE tests you on all the animals BUT you can select extra courses in your field of interest.|Ross School of Veterinary Medicine is English based and is technically abroad.|Most schools have a list of pre-requistes they require.  They like to see people are moving towards a degree but they will accept folks before they finish a bachelors if they're impressive enough.  Yes, if the trade school doesn't have the required credits, it's not helping.  Find out if the trade school has all the required courses and that they're considered acceptable by the majority of schools.",

cl4rkcl4rkcl4rk,">ng shadowing experience is so critical, not just for gaining the experience for applications, but also to make sure you want to enter this field. I wouldn't want to do anything else except vet med, but there are plenty of cons so just be sure that you are 100% invested in the long-haul of vet school and a career in the field.

Thanks for sharing and congrats on getting to where you are now, that is very inspiring! I can see how your background would provide you with applicable skills for veterinary practice. Also thank you for pointing out that you started out shadowing before getting a position as a veterinary assistant. I was thinking I'd try to get shadowing experience after I had some experience as a VA, but maybe I'd have better luck the other way around. Can I ask, did you continue working your substance abuse/psychology job while shadowing? If so, how did you balance your schedule?|[Cross posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/1aboevd/looking_for_guidance_from_veterinariansvascvts/) \- I didn't see this until after I submitted my own post:

&#x200B;

Hello,  
I know that this community has a lot of fearless career changers and am looking for guidance on making the leap into veterinary medicine. I am in the early stages of pursuing vet med, and am having a difficult time getting hired as a veterinary assistant without experience or certifications.  
**I’m looking for:**  
\- Any critiques on my action plan (see below) for completing prerequisites and gaining experience before applying to DVM programs  
\- Suggestions for how to break into the veterinary field and gain experience for the DVM application  
\- Stories from people who have successfully changed careers and earned entry into a DVM program  
\- Stories from others who are currently pursuing a career change into veterinary medicine  
\- Advice from anyone who works in hiring for veterinary assistant positions  
**Additional context:** Over the last few years I have had a nagging need to find a more suitable career for myself. I have a successful career in Health IT, but as the years go by, I have realized that I am not passionate about my work, and need something where I have a more tangible impact on my community. I have bounced around the idea of becoming a veterinarian for years, but I always wrote it off as unrealistic because I have no background in sciences (I majored in economics), have never worked in a veterinary clinic, and would be giving up the financial security of my current career. After much thought and deliberation, as well as some research, and anecdotal evidence of people making career changes into this field, I now feel that becoming a vet is not something I want to do, but something I need to do.

**Action Plan:** I have mapped out the prerequisite courses that I need to take and determined that I could complete the remaining courses in as little as one year, though I know I may need more time. I want to use this time to also gain veterinary clinical experience as a veterinary assistant. If I follow this plan, and work hard, I believe that I could be accepted into veterinary school within the next 2-3 years. I feel highly determined, courageous and energized about making this career change a reality and have a supportive partner who wants to see me achieve my dream.  
**Current Roadblock:** I have applied to several Veterinary Assistant positions in my city, but I have been met with many swift rejections (without a callback or an interview). I understand that I do not have clinical experience, but I do list several animal experiences on my resume, including: managing a veterinary health data transformation project, creating a partnership with the local humane society for a philanthropy event in college, and owning a dog as animal experiences. The rest of the resume summarizes my professional experience in Health IT, where I have successfully led complex project teams for 3+ years.",Other

MissAnthropy_YIKES,"I've found that I have a much easier time with the domestic pet euth situation than with the industrial euth situation. In the former, enormous effort is taken to show respect and deference for the life and experience of the animal and the owner with whom they have a relationship.  In the latter, the lack of such respect is much harder for me- there's much more internal emotional friction. 

Every time I've had a particularly difficult euth and have shown personal emotion in front of owners, they have only taken it positively. They clearly take it as a validation of the relationship they have with their pet, validation of their current emotional response to losing their pet, and so on.

Wvp has been surprisingly painless. No one has quit. They're intentionally pretty hands-off, especially compared to what was expected. They made sure our practice manager and medical director (lead doctor) were competent, and now they leave things to us, mostly.

diene_slowly,I had my clinic help me by saving used vaccine vials for about 6 months. Then I ordered a foam wreath off Amazon. The only glue that actually worked on the foam was hot glue which they say no to use on foam bc it disintegrates it but I used such a small amount per vial that it was fine. I basically just individually glued each vial to the foam one ring at a time! Then order an over the door hook to hang it.

mmmarmy,"To your point 3, you will not 'live the rest of your life in debt' as an academic veterinarian. Working at a veterinary school will make you eligible for PSLF loan forgiveness, and some residency programs will also qualify for PSLF (aka your 3 years of residency count towards your 10 years/120 monthly payments), meaning it would only take 7 years of making minimal payments as a professor to have all remaining debt forgiven.

Naamch3,"Imposter syndrome sure seems to hit a greater # of people in this recent crop of college grads. I wonder why? But for your purposes please don’t let it stop you. Most others in a range of graduating years near you had the Covid impact as well. I have two suggestions. #1 pursue your dream vet job and let nothing stop you…especially yourself. You will grow old regretting it. Knowing you gave up on your dream b/c you lacked confidence will gnaw at you forever and could destroy your mental health over time. Once you get your vet job and are treating patients I doubt the vet practice will allow you to be a sole decision maker on critical cases at first. You and they will want to have an experienced voice in both diagnosis then treatment. Also, be open during your interview. Let them know how much you want the job and ask about mentorship.  Like any medical position a credible veterinary practice will want to assess you before they allow you to fly solo. It might help if you interview at larger practices where they might have more mentoring options. Be upfront about your nervousness. They will appreciate it and tell you that it is normal. If you get an offer from a veterinary practice that doesn’t give you the confidence that there will be mentorship as well as various checks to ensure you cause no outlandish harm then just keep interviewing. Please don’t let that voice in your head cause you to take a desk job and god forbid you take a government job. That sounds like a recipe for a lifetime of regret and pain. I don’t know you but I assume you are better than a government job.

Option #2, if you really are paralyzed by your imposter syndrome then what about interviewing for nurse or technician jobs at vet practices? Or vet / doctor assistant? I apologize for not knowing the right vocabulary for these positions. Sure the pay won’t be what you could make as a veterinary doctor but it provides for a slower start and a longer runway to get your feet under you. As for the economics, assuming the ‘nurse’ job builds you into having the confidence to flip to veterinary doctor then the lifetime earnings will far exceed the giving up option of pursuing that banal government desk job.

Hope this was helpful. A rule of thumb I often use is this, you have only two people in this world to make proud of you. Those two people are your eight year old self and your eighty year old self. Keep them in mind as you choose between pursuing the veterinary career you’ve trained and worked hard for versus the government desk job option.","This comment should be classified as ""Other"" as it provides advice and encouragement to someone pursuing a career as a veterinarian, but the person giving the advice does not fit the criteria of a practicing veterinarian or consultant to veterinarians/clinics."

ohfuckmeee,"I'd say the answer to this question is completely dependent on what you would have to pay for said minority shares and the EBITA margin of the business. Think of it like any other investment

If you have to pay top dollar for the shares, or the EBITA margin of the business sucks, then you might be better off putting the money in a different investment and just working there.

If you're getting the shares at a discount rate, the EBITA margin is healthy, and you feel comfortable in the stability of the business, then probably a good idea if you don't need the money right now.

An additional factor is I'd also try to estimate how much this will obligate you to engage in managing the business and then if you're not going to get additional compensation for that, do a mental cost benefit analysis of the time you'll invest in the managing compared to the dividend revenue and expected cap gains of the equity. If that math doesn't add up then I'd probably not go forward either.",Other
Legal_Estimate_2070,"I completely agree. It’s wild to suggest incompetence for struggling with those procedures fresh out of vet school. Ask any experienced vet and they will tell you obese OHT are never basic. Heck our senior vet who is NEVER flustered has 24 years experience and is known as the “fixer” for every soft tissue complication/error for every vet in our area (not just our clinic but ALL of them) admitted she feels a little bit of nerves when she sees a fatty bitchy spay on the list…
She’s amazing I just love her, she’d never disparage a new grad for a lack of experience. She supports everyone.|I saw that and felt the same. So much reactive hate and misinformation. The dog was very unwell with multiple metastatic masses, the history was unclear/contradictory and the OOP was clearly very angry and emotional. I really feel for the person whose dog passed but also for the vet staff that many people are now wishing harm on.","This comment should be classified as ""Veterinarian"" as it discusses the struggles and challenges faced by veterinarians, specifically mentioning a senior vet with 24 years of experience."
Useful_Parsnip_871,"Hmmm 🤔 

Have you thought about a career as a scientist? I went to vet school for 2 years but changed my mind and instead went to grad school. I’ve been working in industry for almost a decade. I work remote, make 6 figures, 4 weeks vacation, retire matching of 10%, bonus 15%, and I’m thoroughly challenge intellectually. Part of my job is to spend time learning new things in my research area. Just a thought.|Had this happen to me. I ended up turning my life around and became a scientist instead. Now have a great WFH job at Fortune 500 biotech doing scientific consulting work for genetically modified mice. Life is better now.|I want to add I’ve had bipolar my whole life making things a little extra “testy”. I just fought harder",Other

amyamv13,"I was a tech for several years before vet school, now I’ll graduate vet school in a year! But one of the cases that always stuck in my heart was this sweet little cat. Her mom was the nicest person, and her poor kitty had Cytauxzoon felis. My personal cat came to the clinic to be her blood donor. Her mom was so kind and grateful. I let her come by over the weekend while I took care of boarders to spend time with her baby. 

Sadly her sweet kitty didn’t make it. But she made sure to tell us how much she appreciated the care we gave her. A few days later she brought me a gift bag with a hand written card, and toys to thank my kitty for his donation to try and save her. She got my cat a box of her kitty’s favorite treats too, which are now my cat’s favorite to this day. I’ll never forget her|That is awesome, we are getting so close!!|I didn’t quite have a 4.0, but our stats were really similar. And I also had solid experience, LOR’s, and essays (I thought). And that happened to me too. I really did feel like shit! Actually I didn’t get in until my third try. Now I’m almost in my 4th year of vet school, so don’t give up! They say it’s because there’s just so many strong applicants, which is partially true. But honestly I think part of it is just roulette or them checking their boxes to have an inclusive class. 
Because once I got in I have many classmates that have ZERO vet experience or much lower GPA’s. At first it made me a little upset, like how did it take me this long? But we are all doing well, are just as committed, and deserve the chance. Admissions is just weird and don’t let it get you down for too long. 
Also looking back, I feel like I got in when I was supposed to, even though the rejection felt like shit at the time. I love the experience I got during my gap time, I ended up getting my Masters in Public Health too. I got to spend irreplaceable time with my family, which I appreciate so much now since my mom passed away right before starting vet school. I think it all happened how it was supposed to. 
You got this! Expand your application pool next year, don’t give up! You’re going to kick ass.|Eclinpath is so helpful! I’ve learned a ton from them!!",Other
